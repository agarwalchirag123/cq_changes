(2, 1, 'Introduction', 'Hello Diwakar! This is Sadhvika from Communiqué. Heartiest congratulations on being placed at Lam Research. If I have your consent may I take a short interview with you?', 'Thank you Sadhvika! Yeah sure, let’s have a discussion. Please go ahead.'),
(3, 1, 'Why core..!!', 'How did you decide to go in the core profile considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about?', 'I had a liking for core mechanical engineering from the beginning itself, which did not change at any stage. I also knew about the various on-campus/ off-campus opportunities available in the domain. I had the interest and the confidence to excel as well, therefore, there was no reason I switched to other profiles.'),
(4, 1, 'Interview process', 'What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for?', 'Most of the technical companies have similar interview processes. The first round is the technical round which generally takes about an hour. In this round, they cover up much of the whole mechanical course curriculum. The second round is the HR round but they did ask some Engineering intuitive questions in the interview of LAM Research and it took about 20–30 mins. Regarding written rounds: For Bajaj, we had the aptitude and core-based questions in MCQ format. The questions asked were theory-based, no numerical and relatively easier than others. The questions asked for the written round of placement for Lam were the most challenging and different according to me. The questions were subjective and were to be handwritten and uploaded in a portal that was provided. They had 8–9 questions to be solved in about 90 mins or so. The questions weren’t routine and they checked how strong your basics and application of concepts are. The second round is the interview round. Here I’d like to mention one thing that is even though my interview with Jaguar went very well, I wasn’t selected. The reason being that they had less vacancy and they preferred other candidates who had exposure in the domain of the automobile through some research group or research project they had been a part of. Bajaj also needs candidates with previous experience in that field. So my advice is that if you wish to join this field you should take an initiative to be a part of a research group or take a research project in this field.'),
(5, 1, 'Relevance of CGPA', 'Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement?', 'A good CGPA helps a lot. They are important for you to get selected for the interview round as the companies consider it along with the test scores. So above 8 is good enough, and above 8.5 would be a great place to be. Having said that the people with an average CG may also get shortlisted but make sure you have a good reason for it. Like you could back it up with a research project saying that you were more focused on gaining practical knowledge and such.'),
(6, 1, 'Study resources', 'Any resources you’d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc.', 'In my opinion, there is no need for additional courses because the college course curriculum covers everything you need. So if you are thorough with the curriculum then you will be able to crack the general placement process in the core. The additionals offered are very specific for a certain field and if you are preparing for a general core placement, then the course curriculum is your key. Taking additionals should solely be one’s own choice, based on the interest they have. Here I would also mention that many ignore their 1st and 2nd-year basic courses but they are the conceptual foundation, questions based on these are also asked in the interviews as well. So when you prepare for the placement I would advise you to revise all the concepts from your 1st year itself. It is not necessary to take up additional courses or any online material. Your course curriculum would be sufficient for the theory part. You should revise your concepts from a reference book because I believe that reading helps in better understanding and retaining the knowledge for a long time. And if you have taken up research or an internship you might need to learn software or two which you could from the many videos available on youtube and any other online platform.'),
(7, 1, 'Strategy for preparation', 'What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'First of all do not aim for just a single company and put all your energy behind it. You should aim for a set of 5 to 6 companies you wish to get into and focus on them and prepare accordingly so you don’t panic at the last moment. So my strategy was to prepare short notes of the topics as I revised them so that I could recollect all of them at the end. So in the last semester that is the placement semester I started preparing in this way and in 2–3 months I had covered up all the core engineering subjects and I had all the short notes ready with me. So whenever I had a test for a certain company it was very easy for me to revise the topics relevant to the profile of the company.'),
(8, 1, 'Opportunities in core', 'It is generally said that there are fewer opportunities in the core sector than non-core sector. Is this the case and is if so what are the opportunities we should look out for and focus on?', 'There are many opportunities in the core sector though they may be less in the campus placements, there are many out of it. You can always get very good PSU jobs through GATE and you get into government sectors through engineering services examinations. Apart from that, there are examinations conducted for ISRO, DRDO, BARC, and so on. So opportunities are there. We just need to explore and have an open mind towards it.'),
(9, 1, 'Research under a prof', 'How often do we get an opportunity to work on a research project under a professor on the campus?', 'It truly depends on the professor. Like some professors who are quite reputed for their research in the department, they like to take students early. They would have students under them from the second year itself. It would be difficult to get a project under them in the later years. So you could approach them in the second year itself when you are well acquainted with a few core topics and learn your interests. But yes, BTPs and MTPs are also a very good option since 2 years is also enough to get a good yield project in the core. BTPs and MTPs are not difficult to get under a professor of your choice, but it is always advisable to start early on. To get a good project, you should first check the profile of the professor and learn what his field of research is. This can be easily learned by the institutes’ webpage for the faculty department. And then you need to explore a bit on your own so that you are properly acquainted with it and make sure the research is relevant to the industry. So now when you approach a professor saying you are interested in his research and wish to work under him, seeing that you are well informed about the project, you have significant chances of securing the opportunity. You should also take initiative from the beginning itself to get the best out of the professor because several students are working under him. So he would focus on you only if you show interest in it. Some of the professors also consider your CGPA but not many. So if you show a real interest in the domain, CGPA shouldn’t be a problem.'),
(10, 1, 'Advice to juniors', 'What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year?', 'I would advise them to focus on the thing under their control. With the circumstances of today, a lot of things might feel uncertain and chaotic. So keeping your focus is very important. Like for example, I had expected to get into ISRO as it had been visiting our campus in the past few years but at the last moment, I was informed that it wouldn’t visit the campus this year. So in this situation, you should try to focus on the fact that you still haven’t lost the opportunity and you have a lot of time to prepare and things like that. Because your efforts and hard work will never be wasted and will always pay off well.'),
(11, 1, 'Internship in second year', 'What is your opinion on taking an internship in the second year?', 'Considering the time we all are facing I’m sure how possible it would be to get an internship in the core industry and that too for a second year. The reason being the restricted mobility now. But even if you don’t have an internship, you can always approach a professor. Working under a professor in the second year is very underrated when it is a great opportunity to get an insight into the core domain that not many of your peers would have. In my opinion, it is the best possible use of your time.'),
(12, 1, 'Message for the Junta', 'What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them?', 'I would like to say that you need to maintain a balance in your life. Academics are important but so is socializing and developing your personality and making friends for life while on campus. As you’re not only going to take a degree with you but also the memories of the years of your life spent here, to cherish for a lifetime. So be a better judge of yourself to know the right time to do what. When you will be able to judge yourself, that’s when you will enjoy your life here to the fullest and never regret what you did.'),
(205, 2, 'Interview process', 'Hi everyone, we have Aarushi Gupta today, who recently got placed at Dalberg. So Aarushi, I will be asking you a couple of questions regarding the strategies to crack the interviews of consulting companies.  What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Also, please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'Well, I interviewed only for Dalberg. We started with a primary shortlist round; there were around 40 people. And after that, we had a test. About 12–13 people appeared for the test.  Then we had a buddy session; there was a buddy assigned to all of us from Dalberg itself. So this buddy round went up to two weeks. My buddy did two cases with me, and she guided me on things to do. I am not exactly sure if this round is evaluated, but they help a lot.  After this, we had interviews. I had four interviews conducted over two days. The first two were the senior consultant rounds, and the next two were partner rounds. The actual interview was an hour-long- 20 minutes for HR and 40 minutes for the case.'),
(206, 2, 'Questions asked', 'Okay. Moving ahead, Could you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Like the Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'Right. So all the HR questions were general. The first question is always to introduce yourself. The next they ask is why consulting. Also, why social consulting in my case and why Dalberg in particular. So these are the questions I feel are common in every interview. All they want to know is about your interest and your preparation.  Apart from that, they asked about my previous internships or PORs, anything they felt was interesting in my CV. So preparing your CV well is important. In the end, their questions were a bit different like what my plans were for the next five years in the future or particular instances by giving examples a little more in detail.  As for the cases, all four of them were based on development sectors on actual projects my interviewers worked on. So they didn’t have a separate questionnaire; each one of them asked something from their previous experiences.  If I have to talk about the actual questions asked, the first question I was asked was the development of the economy in a smal'),
(207, 2, 'Advice for further placements', 'Okay, Aarushi, What do you think are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now on to maximize their chances of getting through a company in consulting?', 'So solving cases would help. I noticed in my Dalberg interviews that they were very off the books and did not follow a specific framework. So if you’re already familiar with the process, it becomes easy to answer every problem given to you. So practising is going to be helpful. It’s better to make a group and start practising as early as possible. Practising with others and getting ideas from someone who knows better is very important.'),
(208, 2, 'Preparation after shortlisting', 'Okay. Moving on. Please tell us how your preparation for case rounds evolved once you were shortlisted? Also, please let us know about the resources you used as well.', 'I practised with my batchmates and people around me for case rounds. Also, practising with seniors is something you should focus on to know where you’re going wrong. We used IIT Madras and IIT Bombay case books. I did cases from these books, and once I got my buddies, the format changed. I then started with cases quite different from those given in books, the development-based one. My buddy helped me understand how to approach different problems. Also, a book called “Case Interviews Secrets” by Victor Cheng gives a broad idea of what you’re supposed to do in the field.'),
(209, 2, 'Message for Junta', 'So, now we have almost come to the end of the interview. Anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'I think preparing for HR beforehand is essential because you have to come up with something that impresses interviewers. Try interacting with the interviewers because the cases are not necessarily straightforward. So interacting is very important since they can change the flow of the entire discussion, and you have to pick up on what they’re saying and react accordingly. These are a few things that books generally don’t teach us.'),
(210, 2, 'Conclusion', 'That’s all from our side, Aarushi. Thank you for being with us.', 'Thank You!'),
(211, 3, 'Interview process', 'Hello everyone, today we have Shashank Sinha who has been placed at BCG. So we are here to interview him regarding his preparations and strategies to crack the interview of this company. So firstly what was the general interview process for the companies you interview also Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'So I interviewed for the Boston Consulting Group and I’ll be talking about the recruiting process of BCG only. The process usually starts with the initial CV shortlisting round so there will be around 27 folks getting shortlisted based on their CV and once you are shortlisted then in 10 days, you’ll have case rounds with associates and seniors associated with the firm. So there are usually 2–3 rounds based on how you perform in those rounds and once this is completed you will have a span of 3 days in which you will have final interviews which will be with the principal and partners of the firm. In the principal rounds, the number of interviews will vary from 1 to 3 and again for partner rounds it will vary but most will be 2. The process roughly remains the same across years but the timeline usually varies.'),
(212, 3, 'Questions asked', 'Thanks Shashank for explaining the general interview process. Now can you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'So in each of the rounds that I have mentioned there will be on an average 6–7 interviews by combining all the rounds and each of them will have 2 sections, first will be your experience section which is your CV discussion part and then there will a case round, roughly there will span of around 30 minutes for which interviews will last. 2–3 minutes for the initial round of personal experience then around 20 mins for case solving and 2–3 minutes for your questions for the interviewer, this will be the general structure for each of the rounds you will go through. So regarding questions, in terms of case studies, the cases generally can be broken into four parts which are guesstimates, profitability, market entry and unconventional. So in the initial rounds, you’ll have mixtures of the first three parts i.e guesstimates, profitability and market entry cases, these cases can be in isolation or a mixture and in the final round you will have mostly unconventional cases. So I’ll brief in my case, in my first two rounds I had a mixture of guesstimates and market entry and when I advanced to principal rounds, first I had a mixture of guesstimates and profitability and after that, I only had unconventional cases. For instance, in one of the principal rounds, I had a question like suppose there is a steel manufacturing company and I had to suggest recommendations to lower its cost.'),
(213, 3, 'FAQs for HR round', 'That would be helpful Coming to the next question What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'So in terms of HR questions, BCG doesn’t, in particular, has any HR round. In all the 6 rounds, they will ask questions based on your personal experience, they’ll check your personality so firstly you have to introduce yourself and then they’ll pick one of the relevant questions like regarding your recent internship or any other interesting section they find and then they will grill you on that. And once you advance through the partner rounds then the so-called fit / Hr questions come in. As in my case, was, I had a similar kind of role in my internship So they asked, “Why management consultancy and why BCG in particular ”, “Where do you see yourself in the next 4–5 years and what are your future goals and how you see those goals aligned with you spending your time at BCG” and then there will surely a question when you are interviewing for the consulting firm “Whether you want to do MBA or not”. These are some of the questions which they typically ask but with BCG your case solving skills is one that carries more weight.'),
(214, 3, 'Advice for further placements', 'That’s rightly said, so the next question is What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now to maximize their chances of getting through a company in consulting?', 'So in any of the consulting firms you sit for, the process starts with CV screening and what they look for is “Spikes in your CV”, a term you commonly come across when applying for the consult. So you need to have at least a couple of spikes in your CV to get shortlisted and what I mean by spikes is like being in the top 3–4 candidates who have applied for the firm in that particular genre or in each of the parts that you have in your CV which are Academics, Intern, Position of responsibilities to name a few. So elaborating further, when we talk about academics, having CG above 9 is considered to be a spike, or your department rank 1 or 2. Coming to internships, having a Day 1 internship will be counted as a spike but not only that even if you secured an off-campus internship but at a very reputable firm i.e top in their respective sector then coming to projects if you have FT over there, then surely that will be counted as spike and coming to extracurricular activities if you have Inter-IIT medals that will help or any regional or national awards and when it comes to the position of responsibilities then VP, Placecomms, Gymkhana Gsecs, Senate positions and senior positions in the clubs and cells will be counted as spikes. These are just rough approximations and may vary from firm to firm on how they define it. Moving on to how you need to prepare, first you need to make case groups and the best time for this is in Summers while you will be interning so that you are not left out. Its usually recommended that your case group size is around 3–4. For case prep, there are no resources available, but to start you can watch “Case interviews cracked” workshops by IIT Bombay available on Youtube .so once you have started on then there are 2 case studies books which people usually follow IIT Bombay’s “Case interviews Cracked” which has a good no of questions and then “Day 1.0” from IIT Madras. These are the 3 particular sources which I referred to as I had 12–14 days to prepare so as I had mentioned you should ideally have 3–4 people in your case group and combining cases from both these books you will have roughly 80 cases, so no of cases that you have is very limited and so you don’t need to waste your cases so what I mean from that is, like in your case group there will be different people who’ll be making you do cases and then there will be you who will be making them do the cases. So whichever case you are making them do, basically you are reading through the cases so whenever you read through the case the case gets wasted because the core part of it like you solving the case without initially having a run through the cases is crucial as then your raw thinking comes into play as in the hindsight the case would seem very obvious. Now coming to the number of days you need to prepare so 40 days is usually considered ideal but in our case even 15 days sufficed. Now apart from the case-solving skill that you will find in the resources mentioned, your communication and business intuitions are very critical and those are something which you can start working right now, when you read about businesses and you know how different businesses work, how strategic decision making is done, you find yourself in an advantageous position as cases are business scenario simulations. To work on it you can read books on investing or you can refer to Twitter handles and news sources like the Ken. With around 8–9 months left for a candidate to prepare even if he/she gives 15–20 minutes daily then they can accumulate sufficient flavour of business.'),
(215, 3, 'Preparation after shortlisting', 'How did your preparation for Technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted, please let us know about the resources you used as well?', 'So I mentioned earlier, the timeline you’ll have is very short, For BCG in particular we only had 15 days and in general, the CV submission opens by the time you will be wrapping your summer internships, so there will be a lot of chaos and once you receive the shortlist by then only your prep starts. There are 5–6 skills that are typically looked for which are communication, structuring, mathematics which is problem-solving ability then personality, critical thinking then business acumen. So once you have formed case groups and have started solving cases, you will tend to follow frameworks that you will get used to after solving 4–5 cases. It’s really important you revise each case and learn from the mistakes made and don’t repeat them and try to improvise your framework and make it more and more customized which suits your approach to each of the cases you encounter. Once you have solved sufficient cases in your case group you can start reaching out to seniors who sat for placements in previous years and also try to exchange buddy round cases of other shortlisted candidates.'),
(216, 3, 'Message for Junta', 'So, anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'So something that I have felt in my stay at KGP. Since we have a crowd of around 1500 folks sitting for placements, it’s chaotic as times and people tend to run behind the things just for the sake of glory a particular profile brings with it. So you must take a break and understand where you fit in, try talking to seniors who will help you in the process. Now coming to specifically what you need to work upon is something I have already talked about just to add on that the case groups that you will be forming need to be people who are honest and brutal to you and share the same enthusiasm as you are the average of your case group. Also when you will be shortlisted what happens is that various companies will be releasing their shortlists in a short time so what usually tends to happen is people receive the shortlist in one and not in others so they tend to lose confidence and drop preparation midway so you need to have the right kind of people in your case group who don’t drop the preparation midway. Apart from that since consulting has very limited offers so at times people usually tend to think that it’s not worth investing 1–1.5 months for case interviews preparations but what happens is the very skills you develop from your case preparation helps you ace other interviews be it product, finance or Business analyst. So if you believe you have a knack for it you should surely give it a shot without being concerned about your chances of making it.'),
(217, 3, 'Thank you', 'Thank you Shashank, for giving your precious time for this interview to Communiqué IIT Kharagpur. I hope your interview will help the students in their endeavours and we wish you all the best for your future achievements.', 'Thank You!');
