(278, 67, 'Interview process', 'Hello everyone, today we have Shashank Sinha who has been placed at BCG. So we are here to interview him regarding his preparations and strategies to crack the interview of this company. So firstly what was the general interview process for the companies you interview also Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'So I interviewed for the Boston Consulting Group and I’ll be talking about the recruiting process of BCG only. The process usually starts with the initial CV shortlisting round so there will be around 27 folks getting shortlisted based on their CV and once you are shortlisted then in 10 days, you’ll have case rounds with associates and seniors associated with the firm. So there are usually 2–3 rounds based on how you perform in those rounds and once this is completed you will have a span of 3 days in which you will have final interviews which will be with the principal and partners of the firm. In the principal rounds, the number of interviews will vary from 1 to 3 and again for partner rounds it will vary but most will be 2. The process roughly remains the same across years but the timeline usually varies.'),
(279, 67, 'Questions asked', 'Thanks Shashank for explaining the general interview process. Now can you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'So in each of the rounds that I have mentioned there will be on an average 6–7 interviews by combining all the rounds and each of them will have 2 sections, first will be your experience section which is your CV discussion part and then there will a case round, roughly there will span of around 30 minutes for which interviews will last. 2–3 minutes for the initial round of personal experience then around 20 mins for case solving and 2–3 minutes for your questions for the interviewer, this will be the general structure for each of the rounds you will go through. So regarding questions, in terms of case studies, the cases generally can be broken into four parts which are guesstimates, profitability, market entry and unconventional. So in the initial rounds, you’ll have mixtures of the first three parts i.e guesstimates, profitability and market entry cases, these cases can be in isolation or a mixture and in the final round you will have mostly unconventional cases. So I’ll brief in my case, in my first two rounds I had a mixture of guesstimates and market entry and when I advanced to principal rounds, first I had a mixture of guesstimates and profitability and after that, I only had unconventional cases. For instance, in one of the principal rounds, I had a question like suppose there is a steel manufacturing company and I had to suggest recommendations to lower its cost.\r\n'),
(280, 67, 'FAQs for HR round', 'That would be helpful Coming to the next question What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'So in terms of HR questions, BCG doesn’t, in particular, has any HR round. In all the 6 rounds, they will ask questions based on your personal experience, they’ll check your personality so firstly you have to introduce yourself and then they’ll pick one of the relevant questions like regarding your recent internship or any other interesting section they find and then they will grill you on that. And once you advance through the partner rounds then the so-called fit / Hr questions come in. As in my case, was, I had a similar kind of role in my internship So they asked, “Why management consultancy and why BCG in particular ”, “Where do you see yourself in the next 4–5 years and what are your future goals and how you see those goals aligned with you spending your time at BCG” and then there will surely a question when you are interviewing for the consulting firm “Whether you want to do MBA or not”. These are some of the questions which they typically ask but with BCG your case solving skills is one that carries more weight.'),
(281, 67, 'Advice for placements 2022', 'That’s rightly said, so the next question is What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now to maximize their chances of getting through a company in consulting?', 'So in any of the consulting firms you sit for, the process starts with CV screening and what they look for is “Spikes in your CV”, a term you commonly come across when applying for the consult. So you need to have at least a couple of spikes in your CV to get shortlisted and what I mean by spikes is like being in the top 3–4 candidates who have applied for the firm in that particular genre or in each of the parts that you have in your CV which are Academics, Intern, Position of responsibilities to name a few. So elaborating further, when we talk about academics, having CG above 9 is considered to be a spike, or your department rank 1 or 2. Coming to internships, having a Day 1 internship will be counted as a spike but not only that even if you secured an off-campus internship but at a very reputable firm i.e top in their respective sector then coming to projects if you have FT over there, then surely that will be counted as spike and coming to extracurricular activities if you have Inter-IIT medals that will help or any regional or national awards and when it comes to the position of responsibilities then VP, Placecomms, Gymkhana Gsecs, Senate positions and senior positions in the clubs and cells will be counted as spikes. These are just rough approximations and may vary from firm to firm on how they define it. Moving on to how you need to prepare, first you need to make case groups and the best time for this is in Summers while you will be interning so that you are not left out. Its usually recommended that your case group size is around 3–4. For case prep, there are no resources available, but to start you can watch “Case interviews cracked” workshops by IIT Bombay available on Youtube .so once you have started on then there are 2 case studies books which people usually follow IIT Bombay’s “Case interviews Cracked” which has a good no of questions and then “Day 1.0” from IIT Madras. These are the 3 particular sources which I referred to as I had 12–14 days to prepare so as I had mentioned you should ideally have 3–4 people in your case group and combining cases from both these books you will have roughly 80 cases, so no of cases that you have is very limited and so you don’t need to waste your cases so what I mean from that is, like in your case group there will be different people who’ll be making you do cases and then there will be you who will be making them do the cases. So whichever case you are making them do, basically you are reading through the cases so whenever you read through the case the case gets wasted because the core part of it like you solving the case without initially having a run through the cases is crucial as then your raw thinking comes into play as in the hindsight the case would seem very obvious. Now coming to the number of days you need to prepare so 40 days is usually considered ideal but in our case even 15 days sufficed. Now apart from the case-solving skill that you will find in the resources mentioned, your communication and business intuitions are very critical and those are something which you can start working right now, when you read about businesses and you know how different businesses work, how strategic decision making is done, you find yourself in an advantageous position as cases are business scenario simulations. To work on it you can read books on investing or you can refer to Twitter handles and news sources like the Ken. With around 8–9 months left for a candidate to prepare even if he/she gives 15–20 minutes daily then they can accumulate sufficient flavour of business.\r\n'),
(282, 67, 'Preparation after shortlisting', 'How did your preparation for Technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted, please let us know about the resources you used as well?', 'So I mentioned earlier, the timeline you’ll have is very short, For BCG in particular we only had 15 days and in general, the CV submission opens by the time you will be wrapping your summer internships, so there will be a lot of chaos and once you receive the shortlist by then only your prep starts. There are 5–6 skills that are typically looked for which are communication, structuring, mathematics which is problem-solving ability then personality, critical thinking then business acumen. So once you have formed case groups and have started solving cases, you will tend to follow frameworks that you will get used to after solving 4–5 cases. It’s really important you revise each case and learn from the mistakes made and don’t repeat them and try to improvise your framework and make it more and more customized which suits your approach to each of the cases you encounter. Once you have solved sufficient cases in your case group you can start reaching out to seniors who sat for placements in previous years and also try to exchange buddy round cases of other shortlisted candidates.'),
(283, 67, 'Message for the Junta', 'So, anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'So something that I have felt in my stay at KGP. Since we have a crowd of around 1500 folks sitting for placements, it’s chaotic as times and people tend to run behind the things just for the sake of glory a particular profile brings with it. So you must take a break and understand where you fit in, try talking to seniors who will help you in the process. Now coming to specifically what you need to work upon is something I have already talked about just to add on that the case groups that you will be forming need to be people who are honest and brutal to you and share the same enthusiasm as you are the average of your case group. Also when you will be shortlisted what happens is that various companies will be releasing their shortlists in a short time so what usually tends to happen is people receive the shortlist in one and not in others so they tend to lose confidence and drop preparation midway so you need to have the right kind of people in your case group who don’t drop the preparation midway. Apart from that since consulting has very limited offers so at times people usually tend to think that it’s not worth investing 1–1.5 months for case interviews preparations but what happens is the very skills you develop from your case preparation helps you ace other interviews be it product, finance or Business analyst. So if you believe you have a knack for it you should surely give it a shot without being concerned about your chances of making it.'),
(284, 67, 'Thank you', 'Thank you Shashank, for giving your precious time for this interview to Communiqué IIT Kharagpur. I hope your interview will help the students in their endeavours and we wish you all the best for your future achievements.', 'Thank you!'),

The interview process consisted of 2 rounds as evaluative buddy rounds followed by 4 rounds of interviews on the final day. The first 2 rounds on the D-Day were strictly case rounds, where one case was Math heavy and another one was around Qualitative judgment. The last 2 rounds had both fit and case, where cases were easier and non-calculative but there was a fair amount of focus on HR Questions and Personality judgment.'),

Indian Public Equities Optimal Portfolio Allocation for a long-haul investment strategy\r\n3. Profitability of a Steel Manufacturer\r\n4. Market Share Expansion Strategy for OLA Electric Scooters.\r\nAnd for HR discussion the questions were\r\n1. Easiest and Hardest Internships and learnings from the same\r\n2.

(289, 66, 'Preparation after shortlisting', 'Surely, your advice will be really valuable for all of us. so coming to our last question of the day. How did your preparation for Case rounds evolve once you were shortlisted, please let us know about the resources you used as well?', 'Yes the resources which one can use are:-\r\n1. Books\r\n1.1 Case Interviews Cracked\r\n1.2 DayOne\r\n1.3 Wharton 2010 Casebook( only some relevant parts)\r\n1.4 Some handful cases/guesstimates from IIMA/L and ISB CaseBooks\r\n2. Videos\r\n2.1 Case Interviews Cracked Webinars\r\n2.2 Aaditya Agarwal mock case videos\r\nAnd I regarding the strategy I would like to say that:-\r\n1. It is critical to focus on learnings from each case rather than solving more cases. I spent at least 30–40 mins with the case after solving it with the case partner, in the analysis, I would spend time on understanding how the case could have been done faster/better and would check the strength of my structure by testing it for root causes other than the one that was the case.\r\n2. I used to keep a note of my strengths/weaknesses of each case and used to read these notes twice daily for all the cases\r\n3. Doing cases with multiple partners, especially alumni helped me to develop as an interviewee, and would recommend students to do cases with at least 4-To 5 different interviewers.'),

(291, 65, 'Interview process', 'Hello Sumit! I am Ankit Ranjan from communiqué. First of all, a big congratulations for making it into Fractal Analytics. Please tell us about the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'Thank you. There are three rounds of the interviews before which, they conduct a test to shortlist around 40 students. This year, 42 students were shortlisted based on it. There are a total of 62 questions in this test (2 hours test), four of which are coding problems and the rest are puzzles, math, or English questions. After you’ve been shortlisted, you’ll go through three rounds of interviews. The first two rounds can be interchanged. One round is related to business acumen to understand how much business understanding you have and the second is a tech-related interview. To the best of my understanding, there are two different types of interview processes. One is if you are into tech, and the other is if you don’t have much experience in tech. If you are not a techie, they will ask you some guesstimates or puzzles and will not get too much into tech; however, if you have a tech on your resume, they will focus more on the tech part, as was the case for me. In the first round, I was questioned about one of my internships at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange by a data analyst lead for one of the fractal’s teams. He was eager to understand how I learnt the financial concepts I needed during the project and how the tech implementation was done. They took around 15–20 minutes to discuss the CME project, and after that, they asked questions about my basic understanding of python. Then, I had a second round, after a break of 5–10 minutes. The second round was more of a tech. In this round, they didn’t ask standard DSA Questions, instead, they focused on deeper questions on machine learning at least this was the case for me. As Fractal has a lot of roles, they ask a variety of questions. For me, they took examples of ensemble learning algorithms and asked me about their working. So I had to give them a brief explanation of the algorithm, and the Mathematics behind it. Post this they quizzed me on a different project from my CV, which was my university of Iowa internship and then they asked me about what kind of data structures I had worked on, how did I implement that algorithm and what were things I was thinking of while implementing them. They were more interested to test my understanding of the math involved rather than the implementation of the algorithm. So, this was my second round of the interview. And my entire third round was devoted to discussing my reason for pursuing analytics after earning an undergraduate degree in Geology, as well as what I had done to prepare myself for the analytics sector.'),
(292, 65, 'Importance of project', 'Since you mentioned your project at the University of Iowa, I just wanted to know how significant is it to have a project from a reputed foreign university?', 'No, I don’t think that it is very important. As I told that Fractal’s interview process is more focused on the resume, right, and it depends on the interviewer as well. So in the first round, my CME group internship was more interesting for them. In the second round, it was my university of Iowa Project. So, it’s not specifically about the research internship that I am talking about but it’s more about the work that the interviewer is doing and how it is related to the work that I have done. And of course, adding a research internship and research project to your CV shows that you are more deeply into working on research-based projects, so they are expecting more of this from you. And since my project also focused on my ML work and which is why they asked a lot of questions on it.'),
(293, 65, 'FAQs for HR round', 'Though you have already mentioned the types of questions they ask, I want to ask in particular if there are puzzles or more HR questions in the different rounds of the interview?', 'As I mentioned, my first round contained business understanding questions. Since my intern at CME required a lot of business understanding, my interviewer didn’t go into the puzzle and guestimate side of the interview process but one can easily expect guesstimates in the Fractal interview.'),
(294, 65, 'Advice for interviews', 'How did you prepare for the interview? Any valuable advice that you would like to share?', 'As previously stated, it’s more of a CV based interview, so you don’t have to prepare any different sorts of skills. They don’t expect you to know SQL or DSA, if you have several machine learning internships as well as PORs (as in my case), then you are good to go with Fractal, you don’t have to prepare specific technical aspects. However, you should have a solid understanding of machine learning algorithms and be familiar with guesstimates and puzzles. So you should know some basic case prep and machine learning aspects (for tech) and you should do more puzzles, guesstimates and case prep (for non-tech).'),
(295, 65, 'Making a good CV', 'Since you mentioned the importance of CV in Fractal, can you suggest what should be mentioned in the CV to make it stand apart from the general public?', 'I’m not familiar with Fractal’s real shortlisting procedure. So, I’m not sure how they chose you. Most likely, my test score was the deciding factor in my selection. And for the things to be mentioned in my CV, like for the tech role, I had a corporate internship, a research internship and I do have several hackathons mentioned and apart from these tech-mentions, I do have several good PORs including that of a Hall President, Society Head and Governor. So, I would suggest trying to mention some PORs in your CV which is significant on the campus and apart from this try to put more tech into it. If you don’t have any tech experience, you can still get into Fractal by having a POR-focused CV and performing well in guesstimates. However, they do examine technical skills in your CV. So, try to include more tech in your CV, along with a few PORs that you believe are important on campus.'),
(296, 65, 'Resources for tech domain', 'Can you suggest some strategies or resources that can be helpful for preparation for the tech domain?', 'For the tech aspect, there are two different things that I know. One is on the DSA part — you should be doing basic DSA beforehand. This is a compulsion for every interview process, whether it is fractal or any other company. I would recommend that you take any DSA course. There are various resources for learning DSA, thus I won’t go into detail about them. So, one tip from my side is that you should be well-versed in DSA. There are numerous domains in machine learning, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, etc. In machine learning, I had an internship in statistical learning. I didn’t go into Deep Learning or Natural Language Processing, but I did mention it in every interview. In a machine learning interview, they want to know how much you know about the algorithm and mathematics behind it. So, for that, the first and the basic course that needs to be done is the Andrew NG course. Apart from that, I would suggest stat quest lectures on youtube. Statquest lectures are very beneficial and will give a better understanding of machine learning and its practical application. That is what they expect from you. Just do two internships or projects on machine learning and learn the basic course on machine learning. Like I did Udemy A-Z, Andrew NG course and apart from that, Statquest lectures and several hands-on projects on Kaggle.'),
(297, 65, 'Advice for placement 2022', 'As a pre-final year student, what can students do to maximize their chances of successful placement, especially if they have not done any internship till now and not got PPO?', 'For those pre-final year students two-three things I would suggest. But these solutions will help you if you are sure of going into tech. Firstly, be very thorough with your DSA prep. So, start practising DSA, it’s an important step for any internship and placement. If you are done with DSA then I am pretty sure that you would be landing up in a good job and I believe that 3 to 4 months of DSA would help you in getting a good placement. But you have to be very dedicated to it. Apart from that since my interest was in machine learning among all domains in tech, what I did was just one or two internships in machine learning and had a basic understanding of what machine learning is. So this is how I prepared for my placements and I would also recommend that if you want to go into analytics, then these are the things that will help you in getting a good job.'),
(298, 65, 'Importance of competitive programming', 'One more thing students preparing for the analytics domain are often unsure how much they should emphasize on doing competitive programming. Any advice on that?', 'The point is for the test you need DSA. Four coding questions are being asked in Fractal for the shortlisting process. So DSA knowledge is a must to clear it. DSA is not just about competitive programming, but it is the problem-solving skill that you have. So if you don’t have anything in your CV, then the interviewer needs to know how good of a problem-solver you are, and this is how they prefer to check. From my perspective, you can’t be completely into machine learning without knowing DSA. I am not asking you to do competitive programming on code forces and all but if you have done basic 400–500 questions from InterviewBit or LeetCode, then it would suffice. So if you are looking for an analytics domain, you have to do coding to get placed at good companies. So for getting into good companies like Fractal, you need to have a good knowledge of DSA.'),
(299, 65, 'Message for Junta', 'Do you have any other suggestions for students preparing for placements this year?', 'I think there may be a lot of students facing the same problems during placement that I faced. I couldn’t decide which profile I should choose. So, I prepared for product management, analytics and coding as well. I was into various profiles. Hence I would suggest that you can follow any profile that you want but to secure your job then you should know how to code. If you want to take risks, you can directly work on product management or whatever you want to do. But if you want to get into a tech role, then coding is a must. Once coding is done then 80% of your work is done for placement. So according to me, coding is very important for getting into a good company if you are into tech or unsure about the profile to pursue.'),
(300, 65, 'Thank you!', 'Thank you so much Sumit for your time. It’ll surely be very helpful for all of the KGP junta preparing for analytics profile. Thanks a lot for giving this interview to Communiqué IIT Kharagpur and we wish you all the very best for all your future endeavours.', 'Thank you!'),
(301, 63, 'Introduction', 'Hello Diwakar! This is Sadhvika from Communiqué. Heartiest congratulations on being placed at Lam Research. If I have your consent may I take a short interview with you?', 'Thank you Sadhvika! Yeah sure, let’s have a discussion. Please go ahead.'),
(302, 63, 'Why Core..?', 'How did you decide to go in the core profile considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about?', 'I had a liking for core mechanical engineering from the beginning itself, which did not change at any stage. I also knew about the various on-campus/ off-campus opportunities available in the domain. I had the interest and the confidence to excel as well, therefore, there was no reason I switched to other profiles.'),
(303, 63, 'Interview process', 'What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for?', 'Most of the technical companies have similar interview processes. The first round is the technical round which generally takes about an hour. In this round, they cover up much of the whole mechanical course curriculum. The second round is the HR round but they did ask some Engineering intuitive questions in the interview of LAM Research and it took about 20–30 mins. Regarding written rounds: For Bajaj, we had the aptitude and core-based questions in MCQ format. The questions asked were theory-based, no numerical and relatively easier than others. The questions asked for the written round of placement for Lam were the most challenging and different according to me. The questions were subjective and were to be handwritten and uploaded in a portal that was provided. They had 8–9 questions to be solved in about 90 mins or so. The questions weren’t routine and they checked how strong your basics and application of concepts are. The second round is the interview round. Here I’d like to mention one thing that is even though my interview with Jaguar went very well, I wasn’t selected. The reason being that they had less vacancy and they preferred other candidates who had exposure in the domain of the automobile through some research group or research project they had been a part of. Bajaj also needs candidates with previous experience in that field. So my advice is that if you wish to join this field you should take an initiative to be a part of a research group or take a research project in this field.'),
(304, 63, 'Importance of cgpa', 'Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement?', 'A good CGPA helps a lot. They are important for you to get selected for the interview round as the companies consider it along with the test scores. So above 8 is good enough, and above 8.5 would be a great place to be. Having said that the people with an average CG may also get shortlisted but make sure you have a good reason for it. Like you could back it up with a research project saying that you were more focused on gaining practical knowledge and such.'),
(305, 63, 'Resources', 'Any resources you’d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc.', 'In my opinion, there is no need for additional courses because the college course curriculum covers everything you need. So if you are thorough with the curriculum then you will be able to crack the general placement process in the core. The additionals offered are very specific for a certain field and if you are preparing for a general core placement, then the course curriculum is your key. Taking additionals should solely be one’s own choice, based on the interest they have. Here I would also mention that many ignore their 1st and 2nd-year basic courses but they are the conceptual foundation, questions based on these are also asked in the interviews as well. So when you prepare for the placement I would advise you to revise all the concepts from your 1st year itself. It is not necessary to take up additional courses or any online material. Your course curriculum would be sufficient for the theory part. You should revise your concepts from a reference book because I believe that reading helps in better understanding and retaining the knowledge for a long time. And if you have taken up research or an internship you might need to learn software or two which you could from the many videos available on youtube and any other online platform.'),
(306, 63, 'Strategy of preparation', 'What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'First of all do not aim for just a single company and put all your energy behind it. You should aim for a set of 5 to 6 companies you wish to get into and focus on them and prepare accordingly so you don’t panic at the last moment. So my strategy was to prepare short notes of the topics as I revised them so that I could recollect all of them at the end. So in the last semester that is the placement semester I started preparing in this way and in 2–3 months I had covered up all the core engineering subjects and I had all the short notes ready with me. So whenever I had a test for a certain company it was very easy for me to revise the topics relevant to the profile of the company.'),
(307, 63, 'Opportunities to look for', 'It is generally said that there are fewer opportunities in the core sector than non-core sector. Is this the case and is if so what are the opportunities we should look out for and focus on?', 'There are many opportunities in the core sector though they may be less in the campus placements, there are many out of it. You can always get very good PSU jobs through GATE and you get into government sectors through engineering services examinations. Apart from that, there are examinations conducted for ISRO, DRDO, BARC, and so on. So opportunities are there. We just need to explore and have an open mind towards it.'),
(308, 63, 'Research project under a professor', 'How often do we get an opportunity to work on a research project under a professor on the campus?', 'It truly depends on the professor. Like some professors who are quite reputed for their research in the department, they like to take students early. They would have students under them from the second year itself. It would be difficult to get a project under them in the later years. So you could approach them in the second year itself when you are well acquainted with a few core topics and learn your interests. But yes, BTPs and MTPs are also a very good option since 2 years is also enough to get a good yield project in the core. BTPs and MTPs are not difficult to get under a professor of your choice, but it is always advisable to start early on. To get a good project, you should first check the profile of the professor and learn what his field of research is. This can be easily learned by the institutes’ webpage for the faculty department. And then you need to explore a bit on your own so that you are properly acquainted with it and make sure the research is relevant to the industry. So now when you approach a professor saying you are interested in his research and wish to work under him, seeing that you are well informed about the project, you have significant chances of securing the opportunity. You should also take initiative from the beginning itself to get the best out of the professor because several students are working under him. So he would focus on you only if you show interest in it. Some of the professors also consider your CGPA but not many. So if you show a real interest in the domain, CGPA shouldn’t be a problem.'),
(309, 63, 'Advice for juniors', 'What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year?', 'I would advise them to focus on the thing under their control. With the circumstances of today, a lot of things might feel uncertain and chaotic. So keeping your focus is very important. Like for example, I had expected to get into ISRO as it had been visiting our campus in the past few years but at the last moment, I was informed that it wouldn’t visit the campus this year. So in this situation, you should try to focus on the fact that you still haven’t lost the opportunity and you have a lot of time to prepare and things like that. Because your efforts and hard work will never be wasted and will always pay off well.'),
(310, 63, 'Internship in second year', 'What is your opinion on taking an internship in the second year?', 'Considering the time we all are facing I’m sure how possible it would be to get an internship in the core industry and that too for a second year. The reason being the restricted mobility now. But even if you don’t have an internship, you can always approach a professor. Working under a professor in the second year is very underrated when it is a great opportunity to get an insight into the core domain that not many of your peers would have. In my opinion, it is the best possible use of your time.'),
(311, 63, 'Message for Junta', 'What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them?', 'I would like to say that you need to maintain a balance in your life. Academics are important but so is socializing and developing your personality and making friends for life while on campus. As you’re not only going to take a degree with you but also the memories of the years of your life spent here, to cherish for a lifetime. So be a better judge of yourself to know the right time to do what. When you will be able to judge yourself, that’s when you will enjoy your life here to the fullest and never regret what you did.'),
(312, 64, 'Interview process', 'Today we have Pankaj Mishra with us who has been placed at Mckinsey. So first heartiest Congratulations on that. Pankaj please tell us about the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'Thanks a lot. For Mckinsey, the shortlisting process was different from the general CDC process because you don’t apply through CDC. Instead, you get an email from Mckinsey asking you to apply directly on their website. So all you need to do is submit your CV and fill out the questionnaire on the website. Once you’ve applied, in a week or so you’ll get an email revealing whether you’ve been shortlisted for the interviews or not. This time some 20 folks were shortlisted. The shortlisted candidates are allotted two buddies from the company. These buddies are employees working for Mckinsey. In my case, one of them was an analyst and the other was an associate. After you’ve been shortlisted, there are around 14 days before your interviews start. During this period, you are supposed to talk to your buddies, try and understand how Mckinsey works and whether you will be a right fit for the company or not. You can talk to your buddies about pretty much anything that you want to know or are curious about because it’s non-evaluative. This includes things like the career growth for an analyst, the exit opportunities and the compensation. You should also try and understand the company culture and what is expected from an analyst. That‘s what most of my buddy conversations revolved around. Sometimes in this phase, you also have to go through a digital assessment, which is a proprietary gamified assessment Mckinsey has developed that judges your problem-solving skills. The assessment is a necessary part of the process, but as far as I understood, the assessment score would only play a role if you are on the edge. So long as you clear the interviews by a sufficient margin, the scores shouldn’t matter. The evaluation process begins with 2 interviews for each candidate. These are taken either by associates or engagement managers which is one level above the associates. If someone makes it past the 2 interviews, they proceed to the partner round. So to get an offer from the firm, you need to clear a total of 4 interviews.'),
(313, 64, 'List of questions', 'Could you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'The first two interviews were fairly standard case interviews. However, compared to the typical case interviews (from what I found on YouTube), at McKinsey, they were a lot more conversational, not just in terms of asking for clarification on data or questions but the whole process, in general, felt a lot more like a discussion than an interview. Throughout the interview, it felt like they put a lot more emphasis on establishing a rapport with you and tackling the problem as a team, which was in contrast to the interviews for software roles where the interview is almost single-handedly driven by the candidate with very little input from the interviewer after sharing the initial question.\r\nMy first interview was about an IT giant that was trying to digitize the infrastructure of a client which was a healthcare company working across the country. This meant transforming all the company data to digital format for easier access and analysis. The main objective was to determine the right processes to make this transformation as secure as possible from malicious actors that might attempt to steal or gain unauthorized access to the data lakes. The interviewer asked me to list down all the possible things that could go wrong in such a scenario, elaborate on each one of them and that was it. This was followed by a puzzle about calculating the number of matches that need to be conducted in a knock-out tournament until you find a winner. That was it for my first interview. I was told that it would last 40–45min, but mine got over in about 30 mins.\r\nThe second interview was quite similar. It was about a baby food company trying to expand its presence in the country, gain market share and increase its revenue in the process. Again the interviewer wasn’t focused on or expected a specific answer that he already had in mind. Instead, he picked up the recommendations I gave and drilled further into each of them. He wasn’t trying to push me in any particular direction and was quite excited to see all the different directions I took to tackle the problem at hand. With that, the second interview was also over.\r\nWithin a few hours of the second interview, I received an email informing me that I’d been shortlisted for the second round of interviews with the partners. The partner round was undeniably a lot more relaxed and chilled out. In both the interviews I felt absolutely no pressure as the interviewers did a great job at making you feel comfortable in their presence. The problems in this round were even more open-ended and I would be hard-pressed to even call them a real case interview.\r\nMy first interviewer in this round was a partner with expertise in IT services and digitization. So naturally, he asked me a question about an IT services giant that was trying to expand its business in the country. The goal was not to come up with a very low-level, technical solution. The interviewer was more interested in the breadth rather than the depth of my solution. So recommendations like providing after-market customer care, providing deployment solutions were better received than purely technical recommendations such as adopting new frameworks and technologies. This was followed by an easy numerical problem on calculating the time required to hit some predetermined revenue target given the individual revenue each client brings in.\r\nA few hours later on the same day, I had my second interview. It was taken by Aditya Sharma who I believe takes most of the final interviews for KGP. This interview was extremely informal and very pleasant. It started with brief introductions from both of us and why I wanted to work for Mckinsey. He asked a couple of questions on why consulting as well as a few other fairly standard HR questions like “the most challenging thing you’ve done in life”. So even though the questions were quite generic, the focus was not just on the content of your answers but also on you as an individual. From what I was told later, the objective of these interviews is also to gauge the type of person you are, and whether you’d be a good fit for the team. The work hours for consultants are extremely brutal and they put a lot of emphasis on bringing in only those people who they feel would mesh well with the team.\r\nOnce this part of the interview was over, we started with a case that again wasn’t structured in any specific manner. It was about the Indian Government attempting to boost tourism and reach and eventually surpass, pre-pandemic levels as soon as possible. In short, what would you do to attract more tourists from all over the world? Here the conversation quickly took a candid turn and we started discussing what our country could do to improve its image on a global level and attract people from different parts of the world. He analysed the depth of my argument for each recommendation I pitched with a lot of cross-questioning. Finally, the most exciting part of the interview was a guesstimate to find the number of credit card users in India. It was the most fun part of the entire process because it had the right balance of logic and intuition. That was the end of the fourth interview and the entire interview process for McKinsey.'),
(314, 64, 'FAQs for HR round', 'What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'One common question they asked in three interviews out of the four was to introduce myself. I’d say consulting isn’t so much about problem-solving as it is about being able to express your ideas clearly and in a lucid manner. Of course, they do require you to be adept at problem-solving too, but I’d say most KGPians would already be good enough to clear their bar without any extra preparation. However, when they ask you to introduce yourself, they are not expecting you to introduce yourself as you would in KGP’s orientation programs. They genuinely want to know you as a person. So tell them something that’s not immediately obvious or written on your resume, share your interests and what makes you. What they are looking for is someone they would want to have on their team. In my case, I didn’t talk about my resume at all as they’d have already gone through that before the interview. I told them about my interests in biology and cultural history; something that they wouldn’t expect from a typical engineering candidate. One of my interviewers was also really interested in biology and computer science, and these shared interests quickly helped me establish a rapport with them. So be authentic and tell them about your real motivations and interests. They also want to know if you are genuinely excited about joining McKinsey or is it just another company you are appearing for as part of the placements. So it’s a good idea to spend some time and list down what aspects of consulting genuinely excite you. There’s no reason to pretend as the interviewers are experts at identifying bullshit answers. As long as you are being genuine, the HR questions are relatively straightforward to tackle.\r\nSometimes people think that their ‘genuine’ answers aren’t good enough for the interview, but that’s not true. Even if the motive is just to get a well-paying job, you can always look around on the internet and see what the job entails. Being genuine does not mean you have to be an ardent enthusiast or extremely passionate about consulting as a career. You can always identify what parts of the job excite and resonate with you *after* applying for the job.\r\n'),
(315, 64, 'Advice for placements', 'What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in consulting?', 'I am not sure if this is going to be a good answer because from what I have heard, McKinsey is the only consulting company that has this casual-ish case interview structure where the focus is on evaluating your personality as much as the answers you come up with. Most of the other companies usually tend to focus on the case itself and don’t concern themselves much with other things.\r\nIf we talk only about McKinsey, then one of the biggest things one can do to clear these interviews would be to improve your communication skills. I’d say that is the most important skill they are looking for, maybe even more than your problem-solving skills.\r\nMany people I’ve interacted with share this sentiment, with numerous instances where folks who were never really targeting consulting roles crack these interviews not because they’d been practising cases for a long time, but because they polished their communication skills over the years. Being able to structure your thoughts and make it easy for others to comprehend them is a seriously underrated skill. So practice communication more than anything else, that’d be my one piece of advice.'),
(316, 64, 'Preparation after shortlisting', 'How did your preparation for Case rounds evolve once you were shortlisted, please let us know about the resources you used as well?', 'I hadn’t prepared for case interviews per se because consulting was never my primary goal. But after I was shortlisted, I had 2 mock case interviews with my buddies, and I felt that was sufficient. I’d say as long as you’ve done a couple of cases, you should be good to go because it’s not the problem-solving skills that we’re lacking, but the ability to structure and lay down our thoughts and ideas in a proper manner. I struggled a lot in my very first mock interview because even though the problem itself wasn’t very challenging, I didn’t know how to sequence my suggestions and tailor them so that they’d follow the next seamlessly. What we need to work on is how to think about ideas and structure them so that they are not all over the place, and a few mock cases are more than enough to help with that.\r\nComing to the resources, I used this book called Case in Point: Complete Case Interview Preparation Book by Marc Cosentino which was a recommendation from my buddy. I feel all the things I talked about just now like structuring your thoughts and improving the clarity are beautifully explained there.\r\n');

(317, 64, 'Message for Junta', 'Anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'Somehow people have this notion that consulting is this top-tier job that is elusive to most folks. But I don’t think that is the case. Like I said earlier, consulting is all about being able to express your thoughts in a structured form which makes it easy to understand for the masses. So if you want to grab a consulting job, it would be better to focus on these skills that matter during the interview.\r\nComing to the shortlisting process, I am not an authority on what sort of a resume will be shortlisted and what others would be rejected. But I do feel that the general pattern that these firms follow is shortlisting candidates that have demonstrated excellence in any one particular aspect of their life. I had zero PORs, and neither was I part of any societies or clubs. But I still managed to get shortlisted and I think that is because my resume was loaded with technical experience and achievements. Multiple internship experiences, along with open-source contributions through programs like GSoC helped my resume stand out from the crowd. On the other hand, there were just as many, if not more shortlisted candidates who didn’t have any technical experience but had a lot of leadership experience through societies, clubs and PORs. So as long as you’re doing exceptionally well in any one particular field, you should be good to go. This should also come as a respite for people who didn’t really join any societies early on but still want to get into consulting: PORs are not the end of the line.\r\nAnother thing I’d want to stress on is the difference between good communication skills and fluency, something I see being conflated a lot on campus. People assume that having good communication skills is the same as being an expert in English, but that’s not true. While being fluent in English can be an advantage, it’s not a prerequisite for developing decent communication skills. The idea of communication is to be able to express your thoughts and ideas in a manner such that they are easily understood by the other person, that’s it. Even if you take small gaps or take some time to come up with your words, it’s perfectly okay. Just because someone speaks a lot faster than another person, does not always mean they’re conveying a proportionately greater amount of information through their words.\r\nThat’s all from my side. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or through the mail for any more questions. I’d be happy to help. All the best for placements!'),

In core EC companies, there are mainly three rounds: the test, the PI, and the HR round. HR round of a core company is just a 2 min walk, so you don’t need to worry about that. Some companies like Nvidia don’t conduct any tests. They shortlist on the basis of CGPA. As far as Texas Instruments is concerned, it is crucial to score good marks in the test because the shortlist comes on that basis only, and you will be called for PI in that order. And it is very beneficial if you are among the first few students to appear in the PI (comparatively easier questions!)'),
(321, 28, 'Importance of CG for Core Profile', 'Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement?', 'If you want to pursue higher studies, then you definitely need to maintain a high CGPA. But if you are looking to go into industry, then it does not matter that much. I have known people who are pursuing core but don’t have that high CGPA. Scoring good marks in an exam is a different skill, and this skill is not required in the industry. If you have an interest in the core, you should definitely give it a try. Obviously, you need to clear the cut-off of the companies. Anything near 8 is good enough.'),

Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc.', ' I had stayed in KGP during the summers of my 2nd year. I had attended the VLSI workshop organized by Prof Mrigank Sharad. Nowadays, he has stopped organizing the workshop due to some reasons, I think. Though it did not directly influence my internship preparation, we learned a lot of new things, tried our hands-on simulation, and he was able to increase my interest in the topic, despite the scorching heat here during the summers.'),

How was the interview process?', 'In EC core, only two companies (TI and Nvidia) come on day 2. The next is Qualcomm, which comes in the 3rd/4th week. To be honest, I had no idea what I would have done if I had not gotten the TI offer. I had only prepared for the analog profile. But I think, since the core companies come at some intervals, one should prepare entirely based on the respective company. As far as TI analog is concerned, it is necessary and sufficient to read Razavi. It covers all topics which may be asked in the test/interview in some detail. Razavi even helped me during the internship. I had contacted a senior regarding the type of questions that are usually asked in PI. They usually check the basics. Questions from RLC circuits, amplifiers, negative feedback, and basic Fourier transform are their favorites. The company even gives a list of topics that the student is expected to know.'),

(327, 36, 'General Interview process.', 'What was the general interview process for the companies that you interviewed? Please do mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'I only interviewed for one company that is ITC, but I did go through the process for different companies. So I was focusing on companies based on my core field, mechanical engineering, or semi-core, like an FMCG. At ITC they first have a written round, they give you a form with 10–12 long questions for which they require an answer of 300–500 words, some of them are related to your internships and all, and the others are related to your background, what you have achieved in your life and along those lines. For example, there was a question asking what is my biggest achievement in life to date and another one asked about mentioning an instance where I put my mind above matter or another one like what have I done to create a social impact and similar thought-provoking questions. And then there was a shortlisting based on your CVs and this form, then we had a psychometric test which I don’t think had any consequence on the selection because everyone who appeared for the psychometric test also appeared for the group discussion. Then the second round was Group Discussion for which around 60–70 students were selected. Each group consisted of 6–7 students. Around 20 people were selected from this round for the personal interview rounds. There were two interview rounds, the first one consisting of mainly technical questions with a mix of HR questions. There were two interviewers out of which one was asking technical questions and the other person asked HR questions. After qualifying from that round there was an interview with senior members from ITC, ie. People who were working in ITC for 25–30 years and they were there to mostly judge your personality, asking questions from the form that I submitted earlier or some questions judging your personality and traits. Other than ITC, as I mentioned earlier, I also went through the process of placement for Jaguar Land Rover which had a core mechanical profile. They first had a written round with three parts, the technical mechanical part, aptitude reasoning, and a software part. I got shortlisted for the mechanical part but didn’t sit for the interview, but as far as I know, there they had a single round of interview, which included the technical as well as HR questions.'),
(328, 36, 'Specific technical questions that were asked.', 'Would you like to mention any specific technical questions that you were asked in your placement procedure?', 'So, for the personal interview round, the questions were mainly based on your CV. For me, I was asked questions related to my internship as that was the most relevant part for them concerning me having a professional background. So some of the questions that I was asked were, what was the objective, what was the problem statement and how did you solve it, some technical questions based on the work done there, what were the problems you faced during that, what were the different challenges and what did you learn from this internship, how was your relation with your seniors and so on. Other than the internship, I also did a project so they asked me some questions regarding that too like, what was your impact in the project or like what was your contribution to the project that was solely yours and it was essential to the project. The last one was a pretty challenging question as I had to come up with something unique which wasn’t possible if I wouldn’t have been there. I was also asked some questions regarding the position of responsibilities that I held. Apart from this, they asked some questions regarding mechanical engineering as well which were relevant to the industry, like for example, I was asked descriptive questions from a course that we have in mechanical, applied thermo-fluids, which was to develop a heat balance equation for a fryer which is burning from the bottom and we are adding food from the top with oil and other products. That was probably the only core mechanical question that I was asked.'),
(329, 36, 'What a third year should ideally be doing for placements.', 'As a pre-final year student, what can students do to maximize their chances of a successful placement?', 'According to me, if you are applying to any FMCG or any company that has less to do with the technical stuff than your personality, then you should be focussing on making a CV that reflects you as an all-rounder, a person who has excelled in most of the fields. You have to have a good CGPA, work in different domains, have a good extracurricular record including PORs and stuff like that. Make your CV as dynamic as possible. Apart from that, one should also practice logical reasoning questions, questions dealing with probability and statistics, which will be very helpful in especially in pre-placement tests. So whatever role you are applying for, you should have this part done at least, even if you have not studied probability and statistics, you should at least revise a bit of whatever you have studied in your school. Also, I know this is pretty general but you should have some knowledge of competitive coding is what I have experienced is that even when I was applying for Jaguar Land Rover, they wanted me to have some sort of coding skills as well. Competitive coding is not very relevant to ITC, but many other companies that I have seen require you to have some competitive coding skills, even if they don’t have a software profile. Whereas if talking specifically for FMCG, you should have great problem-solving skills and fluent communication skills, because you have to take leadership roles, so whatever you are saying in your CV should reflect a good problem-solving guy and a leader who can lead the team. Someone who has good communication skills and has his points structured. If you are just entering your final year you should put a major focus on improving your communication skills. You should start by increasing communication among your peers, start discussing more points, try to generate new ideas, and start speaking English more. This is a harsh reality that even if you know a lot, have all the technical knowledge but can’t convey it properly or can’t present yourself then you most probably won’t be shortlisted from the GD rounds itself and in my opinion, GD is the biggest roadblock for people who lack communication skills, so especially in FMCG you should be dominant in a conversation, you should not let people interrupt you while you are speaking and also you should be convincing enough. I highly recommend that whatever role you are looking for, you should focus on improving your communication skills.'),
(330, 36, 'Tips on improving your weak areas and communication skills.', 'Would you like to share any sort of method that you followed or what you did to improve your communication skills and the areas that you mentioned just now?', 'Yes, so, first of all, I would say that you should just start practising. What we used to do was like there were many among us friends preparing for placements and others were looking for internships so we used to sit together to do GD rounds, let everybody speak and then try to help each other out by discussing what were the problems, what things should have been or not have been mentioned, which aspects could be improved upon. We tried to improve each other so that at the end of the day we all can do good in our GD rounds. Apart from that, you should also give many mock interviews. There will be many seniors or even your batchmates who would be willing to help you and even take your interview so that you can have a good habit of speaking well and expressing yourself. So, I could give some major points that you should focus on in an interview. Firstly, whatever your points, qualities or achievement are, try to support it with an example, just don’t come out and say that you are a good problem solver, instead back it up with an example of a situation when you were stuck at something and what was the solution that you gave which was creative, or when you are saying that you have good time management skills support it with something like I was working at this organization, playing sports at the same time managing my studies, or if you are talking about your internship and saying that you produced very good results then try to support them when proper numbers and how you achieved that and so on. Back everything with an example so that you sound more convincing. Secondly, a company is always result-oriented and what they need generally are results, your efforts and all are secondary but what the company would be focusing on from your previous works is what all impact you had in terms of results, so whenever you are presenting your internship or your projects you should describe your work as something that is solution-driven, like by telling them that these results were obtained when I worked on this. When you are talking about a particular internship say that this was the problem statement, these are the things that were required and I delivered these. When you focus on the result, that impacts more, for example, by saying that you increased the revenue of your company by 20% will have a greater impact on your performance. Thirdly, when the interviewers ask you to talk about something, don’t just start answering without giving the answer a thought, pause for a second before answering. Your answer should also follow a proper structure. If your answer is not structured and is not to the point then that reduces the overall impact of your answer, so whenever you are answering before saying something try to make it structural and as much as possible make it point-wise. This was the problem with a lot of my friends, they started speaking before formulating an answer, so you should first think thoroughly, make the answer in points, and then answer. Apart from that, especially in FMCG firms or in any firm that wants you to be dynamic, they want to see you as a good problem solver. Therefore try to mention the instances when you faced different challenges and problems and how did you overcome them, so that they see you as someone who likes solving problems and taking on challenges. This is one of the most important aspects of your personality that they are looking for. These are like the most important points regarding communication skills which you should follow while giving an interview.'),
(331, 36, 'Changes brought in preparation after being shortlisted. ', 'How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted?', 'As I came to know that I was shortlisted in ITC, I started to look for the kind of work that I would have to do at ITC. So I came to know from my seniors that if I get to work in a production line, like in a factory or so, then I would be majorly working on the production part, like if I was in the food segment then I would be working on how I would be applying my mechanical engineering knowledge in food processing, heat generation etc. So my question about the fryer and its heat balance equation was based on that only. So I first found out what are the things that ITC is working on, what are the kind of questions that might be asked from me, then I went on and researched and studied, primarily what I have studied in my curriculum so that I could respond confidently in the interview. I found out that I would also have to work on supply chain management so I got a primary understanding of that part so that if a question arises about what do I know about supply chain then even though it is not there in our curriculum, I can show them that I have a basic understanding of the stuff that I would be working on if I join the company. In my other shortlisted companies which were primarily related to my core Jaguar Land Rover, Airbus or Sony Japan, so in the former, I had to go and study the machine design parts like what are the different designs that are present in a car, what are the different strength parameters and more stuff like this, so asked the seniors from the same company about what questions they were asked and what were the possible questions that can be asked in my interview, then I started by first completing all those topics which were in my curriculum, revised them so that I was completely prepared for that. Also, like for Jaguar Land Rover, I brushed up all of my core related projects and competitions, rehearsed possible questions based on them because there is a high chance some of them will be directly related to their portfolio or at least will be more relevant to them and they will definitely ask questions about anything that is related to their job profile. Similarly, in Sony they were asking for something related to robotics so even for that I had to work on stuff like machine design, etc. I completed the part in around 2–3 days, revised it thoroughly, and practised some questions to be confident enough. In short, try to find the seniors from the company you are shortlisted for, contact them, if they are from IIT Kgp they will be willing to help you, ask them whatever questions that could be asked and then revise whatever was in your curriculum. The interviewers would understand that this was taught to you and generally they will ask questions related to that only, that will be the best way to go ahead for any technical round.'),
(332, 36, 'Other General Advice for students', 'Anything else that you would want to share with the students?', 'Yes, so from the interviews that I faced I understood that the interviewers are primarily looking for a person that is at least confident in himself. Apart from the technical knowledge or the specific field knowledge that you have, whatever you are saying, you should be confident, even if they throw random questions at you. In my second round of interview for ITC, the interviewers were asking some random questions like you are telling me that you did this but how is it relevant and more, so you just need to smile and respond without deterring your confidence level and also back your answer with an example. Like they are trying to judge you in an interview of 45–60 minutes, so you have to show them confidence in whatever you are saying. Apart from that prepare before, like I have seen many guys who did nothing in 3–4 years and in just one semester are trying to appear even for software profiles, that is something that I think is very important, that you have enough time. One more thing is that at the placement time, many people get under a lot of stress seeing other people studying more or something like that but at the end of the day when you get placed that stress seems worthless. If you are good you will definitely get placed, you don’t need to worry about that. The last thing that I would like to add is that people who are preparing should practice the skills of communicating and generating new ideas, solving problems as these don’t just come without practice. It won’t be like you just sit down 2 days before the interview thinking that you would crack it, or you would just do a GD in front of your friends and would be the best person. Try to start such discussions and mock interviews at least 1 month before so that you are confident enough and you can speak whatever you want to fluently.'),

I did my internship at the department of Aerospace engineering, IIT Kanpur. Also, I took BTP and MTP in my department and worked sincerely. Working on these core projects, eventually, I grew my interest in fluid dynamics and the turbomachinery domain.

The 2nd part, which lasted for an hour, consisted of technical questions. The questions were mostly from the field of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering. On the same day, the company released a shortlist (containing relatively less number of people than was expected) for interview based on the performance in the written exam. There was only one round of interview. My interview went for more than an hour. The interviewers asked me technical questions mostly from what I had done in my projects. They were more focused on my BTP and MTP project work as those projects were in the turbomachinery domain (one of the profiles they were looking for). They told me to describe the projects in detail and asked related questions. After the technical round, they asked a few HR questions. The questions in HR round were of typical nature, for example, the interviewers gave me a hypothetical office-crisis scenario and asked me how I would respond to that.'),

However, to get a core job, it is not essential to have a high CG. Because, for many companies, there was no CG bar. For example, in Rolls Royce, everyone was allowed to take the written test. The students, qualifying the written test, were called for the interview. So, I feel, if you have excellent knowledge of core subjects and have done a few projects in a related domain, you can get placed in core companies. Nevertheless, it is always safe to maintain your CG. There are core companies that put a CG bar of 8 or 8.5.'),

For instance, Rolls Royce was looking for three profiles 1) Turbomachinery 2) CFD and 3) Structure. So, having good knowledge in any of these fields is required to be a prospective candidate in Rolls Royce’s core sector. In addition, one needs to have the relevant software experience, which will definitely be an added advantage.'),

In the analytical round, the time limit was only 15 minutes, and there were around 20 questions on different graphical interpretations. I found, the analytical round the toughest in the written test. The technical questions were relatively easy. However, those who are already preparing for GRE, I feel, would not face any difficulty to crack the analytical round. But, others might need to prepare separately for it. On the other hand, in the technical interview, the interviewers mostly asked about the projects. Hence, I don’t think one needs to prepare for that as such.'),
(339, 29, 'Preparation Strategy', 'Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'No. I had only focused on core and only applied to the core companies. Automatically, when Rolls Royce came, I was quite certain that I would apply for this company.'),

Sometime during 2nd year, I decided to go for higher studies. So initially, I had applied for placements just as a backup. My inclination towards Aerospace made it very clear that it was just core profiles which I was interested in. During my 9th semester I dropped the idea of applying for higher studies and started looking for placement options apart from CDC as well. However, I was never really interested in the non-core profiles.'),
(344, 30, 'General Interview Process', 'What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for?', 'In Airbus, there were just 2 interview rounds, but prior to that, we had to appear for an online test that was conducted at CIC. In that, there were 3 sections: 1) an English section (similar to GRE), 2) Logical and Reasoning (which had some simple Maths and aptitude questions) and finally 3) profile specific (which were proper technical questions). My profile was Simulation and Modelling. On the basis of our CV and our performance in this test, we were shortlisted for the interview. There were 2 rounds in the interview. The first one was a technical round. In this, the main focus was on technical topics related to my profile. So I was asked some questions on flight mechanics and controls. It was basically whatever we had learned in our depth courses. Apart from that, they asked me some simple puzzles and programming questions. This is because most engineering jobs need you to do some coding. I was asked some questions on Object-Oriented programming and some simple algorithm-based questions. On the basis of my performance in this interview, I had to appear for the next one, i.e. the HR Round. The questions were like, tell us about yourself, why do you want to join this Airbus, what do you see yourself doing in a few years, what do you know about the company, etc. I was also asked to talk a bit about one of my projects.'),
(345, 30, 'Importance of CG for Core Profile', 'Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement?', 'This is actually a safe thing to do. A lot of companies have very little to judge you, so CGPA becomes one of the main criteria. It is advisable to keep your CG above 8 or 8.5, otherwise, things are a bit unsafe. Whereas in Non-core, CG does not matter as much as in core. But that was not so in my case. My CGPA was 7.81 at that time. Most of the people who were shortlisted did not have a high CGPA. So, it varies from company to company and year to year. This year, Airbus probably required somebody who had done certain kinds of projects so that they suit the profile. Moreover, having a high CGPA means that you are very good with your concepts and serious about your work, but it may also indicate an inclination towards higher studies, which could be a red flag sometimes. Thus, they may not go for candidates having a very high CGPA. It is very difficult to predict what will happen next year. So, a very safe thing to do is to keep your CGPA above 8.5. Another thing is, if you are interested in the core field, you should be good at your subjects. And if you are good at your subjects, a low CGPA may not be justified. People often neglect their academics which affects their CGPA. But you should keep a check on it.'),

I had prepared my profile for higher studies and core jobs in general. I had done a few good projects (term projects, BTP as well as extracurriculars) which suited my interest in Flight Simulation. Through these, I was able to develop the skills required for such a profile. That is how I made myself suitable. For core profiles you don’t need to prepare for placement tests as in case of the non-core profiles. You just need to know your concepts well and brush up the same.'),

Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'This is a question that does not apply for me very much. I was not very hopeful of being placed on campus, because there were very few core companies for Aerospace, out of which I couldn’t apply for all. I just applied for whichever profiles suited me and did not prepare for interviews beforehand. Just after I knew I got shortlisted for Airbus, I brushed up a few concepts and prepared myself for the HR Round. It was a very simple process for me. I was shortlisted on the 29th of November and my interview was on 1st December. Between the rounds, I couldn’t really do much as I barely had an hour in between.

You need to know basic programming and prepare yourself for the placement tests (there are standard resources for that). Additionally, you need to practise how to give an interview and how to communicate well in English. However, if you want to get placed in core companies, you need to prepare a good profile, have a decent CGPA and 2–3 very good projects related to the work you want to do, and you should do them sincerely. Through these projects, you will automatically get the skills you need. These will not only prepare you for core placements but also for applications if you go for higher studies. That said, you should bear in mind that you may not get what you want through campus placements because the options are very limited. A huge majority of the companies that come through CDC are for consultancy, coding, data analytics, etc. Therefore, if you only want a core job, you should also apply off-campus. For the case of Aerospace Engineering, there are written tests for DRDO and ISRO which are conducted by the Government.'),
(349, 30, 'Core and Non-core', 'Is it advisable to prepare for core and non-core jobs simultaneously?', 'Yes, because if somebody wants to do a job later, then, as I said, you can’t depend on Core profiles only. This means you will have to prepare for non-core as well. Moreover, it might be a good idea to prepare for non-core early on, since the skills you develop for technical non-core can also be useful for core profiles (programming and data analytics).'),

Topics asked are in-depth core knowledge mostly related to seismic and logging. Rigorous HR questions are asked as well. ONGC- Their interview process usually occurs pre-placement time. This year it was on the 29th of November. CV shortlist according to branch rank and category followed by Personal Interviews was the norm. They will either ask questions on seismic or logging. Questions asked to me were related to seismic which includes depth migration, velocities, complex signal, seismic attributes, and deconvolution. Two or three easy HR questions were asked as well. Cairn India- They usually arrive on day 1 but this year they came in Phase 2 of placements session. CV shortlist, Test, and GD followed by PI is the general norm. They focus mostly on previous internships and similar questions are asked. HR questions can get rigorous. Exxon- They arrived on Day 4 of the placement process. The selection criteria is completely based on a test. Questions asked in the test were English this year but they can include basic core questions next year. PI questions asked are based on how you use your core knowledge in real-time. This process is more practical.'),

Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'Thoroughly CV preparation is a must for every candidate. From previous internships to every small detail in your CV should be properly covered. The interview process is totally different for each of the companies as I mentioned before.

(358, 37, 'Field Of Work and the profile', 'We have with us Mr Mithilesh Pinjarkar, to guide us on placement in AB InBev. Could you please elaborate your field of work and job profile?', 'My role at AB InBev is that of a Data Engineer. I’ll be a part of the Logistics Data Strategy Team. I will be working on either Azure or AWS, whatever platform the company has. The work of a Data Engineer lies in between that of a Data Analyst and Data Scientist. So to be a Data Engineer, you will need to know at least one coding language, either Python or Java, some basic statistics and a specific language associated with the company’s platform; either Microsoft Azure or AWS. And to learn the Command-Line of Microsoft Azure or AWS, you can always refer to videos available online. This is what is my role in the company as of now. But as an intern in the company, my role was quite different than my role right now. My Intern Role was under the Logistics team and I was to improve the processes at the Mysore Brewery. This role was pretty similar to what is offered to the ITC KITES interns or HUL interns, where you need to go to the factory and they ask you to analyse the whole factory process/ industrial process and they ask you to improve upon those processes. I was especially working on Warehousing and had to travel from Bangalore to Mysore and back. I had to understand how the warehouse was working, from where the supply was coming, and to where it was going and I had to work on improving a couple of processes there. I had to do ABC Classification of Logistics there, I had to improve upon the counting process of the inventory and I should say it was more sort of a Consultant Role.'),
(359, 37, 'Other companies to target in FMCG', 'What are the different companies in this sector one may target?', 'ABInBev is one of the largest FMCG firms in the world, but the roles that they offer in India are slightly different. The point is that the roles offered by ITC and HUL are more like a Field Engineer job. ITC/HUL sends you down to the manufacturing plant and asks you to manage/ improve the processes there. But it is not so in the case of AB InBev. AB InBev has three offices in India, all of them in Bangalore. The first two offices are the Capability Centre and the Analytics Centre, which are like the Analytics Hub for all the AB InBev Breweries across the world. So, the data from the breweries of AB InBev all over the world are sent to the Capability Centre and Analytics Centres, where they analyse the data and give insights and inputs to people working in those breweries outside. Apart from this, there is another office works on India Operations. But people who are hired from IITs, mostly end up at either GCC or GAC. Very few people go to the India Operations Office. But, the three of these are corporate offices and do not match to the roles at ITC/HUL. Therefore, AB InBev does not offer you the role of a Field Engineer during placements, however, during interns, I did get a role of the sort, I being the only one to get this kind of a role because they wanted me to work on Java, and I told them it would take me time to get acquainted with it, and so I ended up taking up this industry project. Also at AB InBev, I choose to take up the job of a Data Engineer because today wherever you go, Data is a necessity. Even if you have a Consulting Role, you will be needing Data as you will be working with company data, and if you aren’t willing to work with it, you will not be able to provide them with the right solutions. Also at AB InBev, there is a rule that after every 9–10 months people are moved across different departments/verticals. So, AB InBev, for the first two to three years experiments with their people, this is what we have seen during our internship also and even now, people are telling us the same on calls. This is not at all similar to the model that ITC/HUL follows, that is if you’re hired for a particular job, you will be going up the ladder in the same department. But, AB InBev is different. There is promotion also in that scene, but you’ll be moving across various departments and then when the company feels you are a perfect fit for a particular department, it puts you into that. And this is a very good opportunity because if you get the experience of 2–3 departments in a matter of 2–3 years, it’s the best thing you can get. Even if you want to exit the company, you will have various opportunities and options. But if you speak about the different companies in this league, I would surely count all the Data Analytics/ Data Engineering companies in the league of ABInBev. However, I’d like to add that if you are preparing for ITC/HUL, you can also prepare for AB InBev, because after all, you’ll be working for one of the largest FMCGs of the world.'),
(360, 37, 'General Interview Process.', 'What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed?', 'To be frank, I did not apply for a lot of companies during the internships. And I got a PPO from AB InBev. So, I did not sit for the placements, essentially. During the time of the internship, I remember on Day 1, I applied for 3 companies, which also included ITC and I got rejected from all three of them. There was also Blackbuck’s GD, after which I was refused. I actually had a third-year intern in ITC, it was off-campus, not a KITES Intern, and I was very specific right from the beginning, that FMCG is a sector that has a lot of opportunities and a lot of scope for growth, and there are a lot of things that you can do and experiment on, also, I won’t be working for a startup where the job safety is a little less, but for an established firm. I also was very motivated at the thought that most of the Data Analytics work that happens across the world, the majority of it boils down to these manufacturing plants. So, I was really inspired to work for an FMCG. The first actual interview that I gave was of ABInBev and that I cracked.');

Could you please list down questions you were asked in different rounds of the interview, puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion that you think will prove to be helpful for the students.', 'So, first of all, there was a test, which is there for most companies, but is not typical of FMCGs; FMCGs do CV Shortlisting, after which there is a GD. For ABInBev, there was a test, in which I remember them asking some SQL questions, some Quant and Probability Questions, and some Logical Reasoning Questions. The test wasn’t that tough, it was fairly easy because as far as I remember, I wasn’t that prepared and was also morally let down because I hadn’t performed well in Day 1/ Day 2. If someone is preparing for AB InBev, there is no kind of special preparation required. And the basic understanding of one coding language is more than enough. There were two coding questions, and I was able to solve one of them, the other I wasn’t able to solve due to lack of time. But when I saw the shortlist list, I could that there was a mix of people who had solved both the questions, who had solved just one question and who had solved no questions. It is because AB InBev also emphasises on one’s CV. And if you have an FMCG intern before AB InBev, that helps a lot. And you have experience with some really big brand; my friend had an intern at Philips; that helps too. The next round was a day after the test. This was the group interview round, which is a mixture of an interview and a group discussion. In this model, a question floats around, for example- what is your biggest weakness? and you need to answer the question one by one. And at the end of this group interview, you face a question that somehow relates to the group, that forces you to make a judgement on that particular group. Like we were asked questions like- if you had to choose one person out of this group to intern with at AB InBev, who would it be and why? And if you had to choose a person who would not do an intern with you at ABInBev, who would it be and why? These questions test a lot of things at once, like how best you can justify yourself and how strong your moral ground is. After this round, we had the interview round. Firstly, people whose CVs were leaning towards Data Analytics were interviewed. My CV had names like L&T and ITC, so it was far away from Analytics, although through my Electrical Courses, I did have some knowledge. My interview was the last one. The interview itself had two parts; they started off with CV grilling, and in my case, they were particularly interested in my ITC intern. What was your project title? How did you obtain your data? How did you use the data? Which platforms did you use? What languages did you use? What were the solutions that you provided for the problems that you identified? What were the metrics that you used to qualify or select solutions for your particular problem? These were some of the questions they asked me. Then they asked a couple of questions that were ethical. Like they asked me- Can you share with us the solutions that you provided here and what were the results you got after using those solutions? I told I can provide you with the solution because that is something that is available online, but after using these solutions the results that I got, that involves a lot of confidential data, so I will not be able to reveal them. They were happy with my answer. During my ITC intern, I had to build a lot of Macros, so they asked me how I built all those Macros. Building a Macro can be just pressing a couple of buttons, but for those who work with VBA and edit Macros, Macro editing is actually difficult. On the same lines, they asked me if I knew how to edit Macros and use VBA and asked me a question about VBA which was easy, and was just to check whether I knew the syntax. After they were done with this ITC grilling, they grilled me on my Placecomm work. After which, there were some HR questions. This was the last round, after which we got our results.'),

Usually, people start preparing for CDC Interviews and Discussions, and those-two weeks of December and they neglect off-campus opportunities. However, for this batch, I would like to suggest that they should start their fight for getting off-campus placements this year, and if you have one off-campus offer in your hand, be it placement or intern, it will be very helpful this time because if everything goes South, you will still be having an offer in your hand which you can rely on. This time, the ed-Tech industry will be on a boom, but some other companies might withdraw themselves. So, I would suggest people to parallel-ly prepare for off-campus placements with their CDC preparation, focussing more on off-campus placements. Wishing you all the best!'),

I was somewhat interested in Engineering drawing and mechanics. Based on this, I decided to stay in my department though I was getting chemical and industrial after the first year. I started liking my department courses during my second year. Hence I decided to develop a core profile. I was sure to not go for a non-core profile as I wasn’t very interested in coding, and it is an essential requirement for most of the non-core field placement.'),

There were three rounds. First, there was a presentation which we had to attend. Then they shortlisted our CVs, and the last round was the interview round. The presentation is an introduction to the company. We are explained about their ongoing projects, what the company does, what services they provide. Like any other company’s ppt, they told us more about the company’s history and the achievements of our Alumni who were placed in the company. At least one of the interviewers will undoubtedly be knowledgeable in your specific field in the interview round. So one should be well prepared to face questions regarding the department courses. Students are also asked about the extracurricular activities they have participated in. Though it’s not a requirement, it’s a plus point. They will surely ask for the details about the PORs one has mentioned in the CV. All the department courses are essential for getting placed in a core company; some specific topics need to focus more on. I had talked to my senior who was placed in this company. He advised me to study an elective that most civil engineering students take up, Construction Planning and Management. General questions were asked. Some basic knowledge about this course is enough.'),

One can be sure enough to put in extra effort and hard work to get an internship and a job. Don’t be demotivated because of your CGPA. Be clear about which field you are interested in. Many of my friends not having a CGPA of more than 7.5 also got placed in core and non-core jobs. If one is not selected in the placement rounds, he can go for engineering services. It is considered to be one of the best jobs in the core field. So there are plenty of options in the core field and no one should let go of this chance because of their CGPA.'),
(367, 62, 'Resources', 'Any resources you’d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg-any additionals you took, online courses, etc.', 'In my opinion, if one wishes to get into the core field, he should be confident in the departmental courses. Nothing more, Nothing less. You don’t require any other course. Most of the questions asked are based on the subjects taught in the 2nd and 3rd year. Hence to crack the interview round one needs to have an understanding of those subjects. If you have a CGPA greater than 8, you need not worry about the placement. Just continue studying at the same pace.'),

Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'I was preparing for Engineering Services before placement. When the placement procedure started, I decided to give it a try. I hadn’t spent much time preparing specifically for placement. Most of my friends had started preparing in the 3rd year itself, but I started preparing just a month before. Before the placement procedure, one can revise some mathematics and Quant, at least the part which is required for the test. A CGPA higher than 8.5 will give you an edge over others and is enough to get into a core company.'),
(369, 62, 'Opportunities in core', 'What are the opportunities in the core sector?', 'There are many opportunities in the core sector. In 2019, the Coal India company started holding the placement rounds in the 2nd phase. One of our seniors also got placed in it. Being a PSU, the company is considered a perfect opportunity. One must have a little patience during the placement process. After the placement, one can even try UPSC. If aiming for a government job, GATE and engineering services are good options. Further studies can be obtained abroad. If you are working hard in any field, you will always find many opportunities. I don’t think it is challenging to get a core job.'),

Any advice for them?', 'If they are in their 2nd year, I would advise not to worry much about placements at this point. They should pursue the things that interest them. It may include being a part of any society or participating in any social, cultural or hall activity. They can also participate in competitions like inter IIT. There are various such options at KGP. In the third year, they can learn new things which can be presented in the CV. If a student is enrolled in the four year B-tech course, he must make sure he bags an internship off-campus in the third year vacation. If not an internship, they must at least contribute to a project under a professor. A lot of 2nd students get training in their summer. That is also an excellent opportunity to get hands-on experience in the practical world. One will understand the requirements of a company and practical implementation of the knowledge gained. It does not matter where you are doing an internship or a project. What matters is how much of an effort you put into the work you do. I hadn’t applied for any off-campus internship during the CDC internship procedure. I thought that I can’t find a core field internship. So I contributed to a project under a professor of the Civil Engineering Department. The project was based on machine learning. Since it was used in around four fields, I found the project very captivating. Finally, I’d say placements should not be the only goal. One must try everything at KGP. Don’t miss out on anything. This chance won’t fall across our paths every day.'),
(371, 19, 'Deciding profiles', 'The first question that comes to the mind is what to prepare for? There are so many profiles and it’s not possible to prepare all of them. So how did you decide what profile to aim for?', 'Ok so I was preparing for consulting roles, product roles, and core companies. My decision was based on a lot of factors, the most crucial being my interest. I discussed with my seniors, tried to know more about the profile, what they actually expect from you once you join, and also about the exit opportunities. It also depended on my previous internship experiences. After analyzing all these factors it was more clear which of the profiles actually aligned with my interests and with my future plans. It is really important to decide beforehand which profile to aim for because you have to then divide your preparation time accordingly.'),
(372, 19, 'By when to decide', 'So for a good preparation and ample time to practice, by what year should the student finally decide about which profile to aim for?', 'It totally depends on student to student. If you realize your passion soon then it’s well and good. Even if you realize your passion in your final year then even that’s okay.'),
(373, 19, 'Interview process', 'Alright. So my next question to you is what was the general interview process for the companies you aimed for?', 'For Flipkart, I applied for the Associate Product Manager role. There was a problem statement released and we had to submit our slide deck containing solutions within a time frame of 10 to 12 days. Based on that slide deck they shortlisted 16 candidates. It was followed by the buddy round. My buddy was an alumnus working in Flipkart. She helped us to prepare well for the interviews. Buddy round could be evaluative or non-evaluative depending on the company. Then after 3 weeks or so there was the final interview at Kharagpur. There were more product case interviews. There were a total of 5 rounds. The 1st round was problem solving, followed by two product thinking rounds. The 4th round was the fit round and the final round was the technical round.'),
(374, 19, 'Questions asked', 'Okay so in each round, what were the questions they asked and any FAQs which you prepared or which you suggest to prepare?', 'Questions were mostly cases. My 1st round was a problem solving round which was basically a case round. There they expect one to identify and solve the problem. The questions could be, for example, the number of users of Uber cabs is decreasing, figure out why and suggest recommendations. Some candidates were also asked to do a guesstimate in the first round where they check how good you are with numbers. In guesstimates, they require you to estimate a number by taking proper assumptions and using logic. So one example could be to estimate the number of shampoo bottles sold in India in a day. The next two rounds were product thinking rounds where they checked the ability to think creatively. One of my questions was to plan the subscription model for Flipkart. The next round was the fit round, a sort of HR round. There were general questions like why this company? Why this profile? Mention an instant where you showed leadership skills. And I was also given a few diplomatic situations where the interviewer wanted to know what I would do in those situations. Then the final round was the technical round. Here, they do not expect you to know coding, but yes you should definitely have a sound technical understanding. For example, how does WhatsApp messaging work? How does GPS work? I was asked questions based on applications of Machine Learning too.'),
(375, 19, 'FAQs for HR round', 'Can you please elaborate a bit about selection procedure and questions asked during the HR round and the best strategy to prepare for them?', 'In HR rounds the questions are very general. I would advise students to be themself, be genuine, and confident. For this, I would suggest them to recall their memory and jot down all their experiences which they think they can share. And it is highly advised to be thorough with your CV because questions will definitely arise from your CV — Why this? And why not this? Why did you take this particular decision? For example — After interning in core companies why did you switch to a different role? So by HR round, the interviewer wants to judge whether you are actually fit for the role, and are you actually interested?'),
(376, 19, 'Advice for placements', 'Okay so my next question is what advice would you give to the students who are going to sit for placements this year?\r\n', 'Yeah so first of all final year students should decide the profile he or she is targetting. Time is limited and preparation has to be specific. Deciding the profile is of utmost importance. Because preparing for all the profiles is likely very impossible. After that, once they have decided they should prepare their placement preparation schedule accordingly and stick to it for the rest of their semester. Generally, companies conduct a preliminary test to shortlist the candidates. The test usually consists of quant, logical reasoning, and English. For technical roles, coding too. Then for interviews, puzzles are most important for all job profiles as maximum companies include it in their interviews.'),
(377, 19, 'Resources', 'Alright, so what are the resources that one must refer to while preparing or rather which you used for your preparation?', 'For solving puzzles there are a few must do’s like Heard on The Street, Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability, and GeeksforGeeks. These are very good sources. And they must revise Probability and Statistics as it is really important. I would also advise juniors to do a bit of coding and now since because of the lockdown everyone has plenty of time they should start as soon as possible. This is for general preparation and specifically for the APM role the candidate needs to prepare guesstimates, problem solving cases, product thinking cases, technical, and HR. So, to prepare well for case interviews first you need to form a case group of 3 to 4 members and practice a good number of cases. The most important aspect of case solving is structuring. So for that, I started with Case Interviews Cracked(IIT Bombay book) to get a grip on structuring and then moved to product cases. The books which I referred to were Cracking The PM Interview, Decode and Conquer, and Preparing for Product Interviews. Also, the case practice should not be restricted within group members and they should try to do cases with other shortlisted candidates also because this is a way where you can exchange your ideas and once you are confident with your cases then they should do cases with alums too. You can find guesstimates in a lot of books such as guesstimate compendium, CIC, etc. For technical rounds they expect you to know the working of websites and apps in general. So start observing and reading more about apps’ functioning. A product manager should be aware of new upcoming technologies, so start reading blogs too.'),
(378, 19, 'Preparation after shortlisting', 'So after you were shortlisted, did you alter your preparation like change the method of preparation/refer to some new material?', 'Frankly speaking, I started my product case prep only after I was shortlisted. Before getting shortlisted for Flipkart I was shortlisted for BCG and Parthenon so I did have an idea about case interviews. I had practiced consult cases. And after I was shortlisted I had to change my preparation. I did product cases more and prepared for the technical round after some time since I didn’t have much technical knowledge. So I started following more technical blogs. I started using more apps, developed a basic understanding of web development, and about ML-DL applications in general.\r\n'),
(379, 19, 'Advice to aspiring students keeping in mind the economic situation during covid ', 'Alright. So now my last question to you is what advice would you give to students who are preparing keeping in view the present economic conditions due to CoViD-19?', 'o I would suggest the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year students explore as much as possible. This is a really good time to explore. There are a plethora of opportunities available in Kharagpur, make good use of it. Try to do courses, projects, grab internships, discuss with your seniors, and try to know which companies and profiles visit campus. It is necessary since most students aren’t aware of what the placements and internships and CDC all together look like. It’s only after exploring you will realize your passion, where does your interest lie? Also, I would suggest them to start coding because we have seen that maximum companies visit for tech roles during placements. Placements are very uncertain so you need to have a strong backup and it would not hurt to add one more skill. Coding is directly or indirectly required in all the fields, and it gives an upper hand too. It would definitely provide a very strong backup for placement. And to pre-final years I would say be calm, start early, and work really hard.'),
(386, 61, 'Why core..?', 'How did you decide to go in the core profile considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about?', 'I had always wanted to work in the automobile sector and that was definitely one of the reasons, I had opted for Mechanical Engineering in the first place after JEE. Also, I wasn’t the jack of all trades. I was a part of the Electric Vehicle Group since my 2nd year and worked there pretty much all the time. So, I had a pretty simple choice, to go forward with the work I did in the institute, mainly for the four reasons: I loved what I did! 2. I was good at it. 3. I had my CDC internship @Lear Corporation in my field of interest and got to explore it. It turned out to be tremendous and spiked up my interest in the area. 4. The field I worked in (Electric Vehicles), happened to be increasing in demand and scope. I searched for possible work scenarios in the area. What are the future opportunities if I continue with the field and whether I like it or not? Some other things you can do are: Talk to the seniors who are placed in the company of your choice: In my personal opinion, it’s always good to get a first-hand insight as experience still speaks louder and more precise. You will have a better idea of the company culture, further growth opportunities within the company, types of projects and work culture, the HR team, etc. Talk to people about their internships: People generally fight for their PPO and try to get an idea about its working environment. But remember they have just interned there, which is very different from doing a job. Remember, an intern is an outsider with a slightly closer look at a company. So, I would recommend going with the point above wherever possible.'),
(387, 61, 'Interview process', 'What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for?', 'I had most of my interview shortlists in the core mechanical companies. My first interview was actually at Bajaj Auto on the eve of Day 2 as I was among the waitlisted candidates for Jaguar Land Rover which comes on Day 1. Bajaj Auto had 2 PI rounds the first round being technical and those who clear the technical interview are called for one final round which is the HR interview. A common question you can find in most interviews is “Tell me about yourself”. The ball is in your court. It’s an opportunity to tell the interviewer what’s not on the resume and steer the interview in the direction of your strengths, or the areas you are confident in. Have a sweet, short story. Some people connect things they did in the past which made them the person they are today (like how you ended up here), about their skills and then end up with something on your resume if that matches the flow. Some people just have a long-ass list of their achievements. Something that can act as a foundation for the interview will work wonders, but it’s okay if that’s not the case; you don’t have to keep it sober. Then they ask questions based on your CV and here you should be able to defend each and every word which you have mentioned there. I had sufficient things to show regarding I am passionate to work in the automobile sector so most of the questions were regarding things related to what I have done at EVG & during my previous internship. Moreover, my CDC internship in pre-final year summers at Lear Corporation was also based on the design of an electric vehicle so all these definitely helped a lot. You can expect questions like what have you learnt from your previous experiences and how you would actually like to implement them if you are hired at the company.'),
(388, 61, 'Importance of cgpa', 'Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement?', 'CGPA happens to be the most important one (sadly) because they filter you out. A lot of companies use CGPA filtering, and being rejected just because of low CG sucks! It’s right at the top of your resume and quickly catches the eye. Some companies don’t officially mention it, but they do sort resumes on CG. But you can actually still get through if you have pretty impressive work on the resume to somewhat compensate for your low CGPA. Basically, if HR asks you why do you have a low CGPA you need to tell him a suitable reason for it. You can answer that you have done well enough in the core courses but due to a few subjects like Biology, EVS, Economics which we are kind of forced to take as a part of our curriculum might be one reason for a drop in the CGPA On the other hand, if you have a high CGPA which can range from anywhere above 9 you would definitely face the question “Why wouldn’t you like to pursue masters or a PhD”? The question can be specifically challenging if you have a lot of research projects and a high CGPA. An answer to this might be you can tell you thought about it, just like everyone else in the institute. But after discussing it with seniors, with whom you’ve worked for the past two years and my parents who know you well, they rightly pointed out that skills are directed more towards working in teams and actual implementation of the projects, which on introspecting made sense. Also, you wanted to explore breadth rather than depth, which isn’t generally the case in research.'),
(389, 61, 'Resources', 'Any resources you’d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc.', 'I was an active member of the Electric Vehicle Group, IIT KGP which I have been a part of since my 2nd year. The practical experience I gained from there helped me a lot in developing sufficient knowledge regarding automobiles. I didn’t use any special resources for preparation. I just used to read things that will bring in some clarity and fill in my knowledge gaps. Question sets from the GATE entrance exam are a good resource for core mechanical Engg. practice. For almost all the core companies they conduct a test which you need to clear to even get shortlisted for the PI round. I was also preparing for my CAT exam which usually happens just before placements so it helped me with the problems in the Quants section. You should have one particular field of engineering you know in some depth (like Design, Thermo, Controls, etc.) Having a peer group to prepare along with helps a lot. We used to divide topics among ourselves for core prep, learn the specific topics, and sit together at night to teach their subjects and discuss them.'),

On Day 2 itself, I had 2 interviews (Bajaj Auto and Alphonso). The extended shortlist of Alphonso arrived when I was actually having my technical round at Bajaj Auto and within 10 minutes time, I had to be mentally prepared and adapt myself accordingly for my interview @Alphonso which was actually based on a completely different profile. So for every company you need to know what questions might be asked in that interview, you need to find out from people(mostly seniors) what is the kind of preparation that you need to have and accordingly you need to change your strategy. Having a predefined strategy for each company is definitely beneficial. The rest of my interview shortlists were on Day 3-Mercedes Benz R&D, Caterpillar & Sterlite. But since I had already accepted my offer I didn’t sit in the PI rounds of any of these companies'),

Look the interviewer in the eye, and speak, in fact, brag, to an extent elucidating why you would like to work for the firm. Never ever go anywhere near mentioning anything that is even remotely your weak point, anything that you have even the slightest of doubts about conceptually, the interviewer can pick a hole and tear you apart from a speck of hesitation and doubt. Always try to guide the discussion, especially in technical rounds, towards topics of your strength, and stick to it. The interviewers have your CV in hand, so they will naturally try to pull you into your projects and internships, so prepare your CV well, so in the first place prepare your CV in a way that you are sure of explaining and defending.'),

Emotions are temporary, but consequences can be permanent. Talk to the people who have worked there. People who have nothing to do with you and people who know you well are the ones who will give you unbiased opinions. After listening to all of them, you are the judge. Say you have two offers to accept, which one would you choose. Say A is paying you more than B, but you value your work life, and after talking to a guy you know in A, you realize A has a shitty work life. You have your answer! Another thing I would like to go with is “Prospects.” Some companies pay you less but have a great brand value. You can always choose to use the experience and their name for a higher paying job later. And finally, RELAX, GUYS! This is just your first job. You have many more opportunities to come. Do the best you can and embrace whatever comes your way. You guys have the grit that brought you here. You can do anything if you decide to do so. Also, your soft skills matter a lot to get you through. You can be a pro in technical stuff and screw up your interview like a pro just because you don’t know how to talk to people. Job is about working with people. So better work on them. Build up the competency you need to get the job; you’ll be okay. HAVE A GREAT PLACEMENT EXPERIENCE!

(394, 60, 'Why core..?', 'How did you decide to go in the core profile, considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about?', 'Right from my first year I was into mechatronics and had a knack for engineering. At the same time, as I went through academics, I got exposure to other areas in this particular field and finally decided to go for controls. I was also interested in the automotive sector, and it got amplified when I got some hands-on experience with research projects. Initially, I was planning to go for higher studies, but I focused on getting an industrial experience first due to uncertainties associated with the pandemic situation. Due to my profile, I got an internship at KPIT Technologies Ltd., Pune, in the automotive domain, where I learned more about hybrid electric vehicles and vehicle dynamics & control. But at the same time, I would also like to say that you can’t ignore stuff like coding and data analytics as everything is getting mixed up right now and converging at the same point. You should know a little bit of coding too, and then look for its application in your field. I also did the coding, but it was not like hard stuff coding, but it sure helped me. You should be aware of different mathematical tools and try to learn as many skills as possible. Interdisciplinary research is a new trend.'),
(395, 60, 'Interview process', 'What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies you aimed for?', 'The process starts with submitting a CV, followed by a test, sometimes GD, and lastly, the PI. CV is the essential part of your whole application. I can’t stress much on this. CV can outweigh all the other aspects of your application sometimes and might make the difference. Airbus is very much concerned about your CV, your prior experiences and the kind of roles you have taken, and the quality of work that you did in the past. It must align with what they are looking for in their potential candidates. Then comes the much-dreaded test, which was a little difficult for my profile which was Flight Physics. There are multiple profiles in Airbus, from which you can choose. There were many challenging questions. They are not on the level of standard aerodynamics that we learn in college. Those types of questions you can’t just study so. Those questions test the basic understanding of things. If you can score up to 50% of the total marks, then there are good chances of you getting shortlisted for interviews. The test is just a criterion if you can answer a few questions on core concepts. Companies look for prior experience. During interviews, there were two rounds: one was technical, and the other was HR. Since everything was conducted online, the experience was somewhat different. More relaxing because you were not facing them live. The technical round for me started early in the morning. The technical team won’t dive much into the details of the work you have done or details. They might, but it wasn’t in the case mine. I think due to time constraints, they get an overall idea of what you have done. I want to point out that you have to emphasise the outcome of your project or work. It would help if you finally had something as the result of all the work that you did. Ina brief statement, you can write what the objective of your whole project is. Then I had a conference paper they started asking about it and my contribution to it. So that was also simple. Avoid triggering the interviewers. It won’t be good to dig deeper, ask tough stuff, and put you out of your comfort zone. Don’t call any unnecessary problems. After this, they started to ask some technical questions. I was also a part of a research project, Airavat-(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). They start with what you have done and asked me what I had worked on. Just get your basics right and practise them rather than doing stuff that is not relevant. Make a good understanding of basic concepts, and you have to present everything properly. Aerospace has multiple domains, and if they ask questions from different fields which you don’t know, say that you don’t know rather than saying wrong answers as it has a terrible impact on interviewers. You can also ask to shift to a domain you are familiar with. It also happened as I am from mechanical and not much familiar with the aerospace part. They would help you out and try to speak out loudly.'),
(396, 60, 'Importance of cgpa', 'Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement?', 'Higher CGPA won’t affect it is always going to help at the end of the day, but yes, this has been an observation that lower CGPA students have also been placed at good companies. I have seen guys with CG around 7–8, which by the standard of KGP is not that good; they also got placed in Airbus, Jaguar and many other good companies. So having CGPA is not as good a factor. If your CV is perfect and you have great projects, it can compensate for your low CGPA as you can say at the cost of This you have good projects. Don’t be worried if you have low CGPA. I have seen that in the last few years, companies are not much into this CGPA. I Have seen Airbus have taken mostly eight pointers in the 7.5–8.5 domain. I would also like to say that sometimes very high GPA will work against your profile. If you have a higher CGPA than regular companies, you tend to go for higher studies, and companies will want their employees to stay. I won’t generalise it, but yes, this is a factor also. CGPA might not be a big concern, but having less than 7 CGPA will affect you as you can’t clear companies cutoff. Airbus didn’t have any cutoff still; I can say around 7.5.'),

It would help if you had a good grip on Solidworks and Matlab for the core. You can have an idea of Machine Learning. I did a minor in Mathematics and Computing. In the interview, they asked why I did a minor in Mathematics and Computing. That was something I was not expecting. I said Mathematics is used overall domains; by help, we can solve different kinds of equations.'),
(398, 60, 'Preparation strategy', 'What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'If you are studying correctly for the four years you have, develop some skills. If you have an overall idea of approaching a particular field, that’s enough. You should have a general idea of general questions that companies ask, say automotive; then you should have a basic automation concept and its theory. If possible, try to get some previous year question from a different company. You can refer to your seniors for screenshots or something like that of last year questions. Be mentally prepared to approach the interview; for every company, there is no hard and first rule for getting into it. We can’t rely on one source. We can go on forums, and we can get questions from students of other IIT’s if their placement season is earlier than yours. People post questions in it. Make some short notes beforehand as you cant go through the whole textbook before interviews. Preparing too much for an interview kills your time better go through questions that have been asked previously sometimes; questions also repeat. Try to practise from previous years.'),
(399, 60, 'Opportunities in core', 'What are the opportunities in the core sector?', 'The core sector has a lot of great opportunities to offer, but at the same time, it is a lot more competitive. For placements, a relatively lesser number of companies might, and you might have to make some compromises on the job profile. As there are a limited number of vacancies, the core becomes something more challenging to get, given that all those competing are already the best minds. At the core, we can’t just sit and expect them to give you a job based on your knowledge. You also need to have prior experience. You also need to have great projects beforehand, which is most aligned with the type of profile you are applying for, and at the same time, if you have a good CGPA and you should be above average in the field, you should be competent. For Core, Sector perseverance is the key. Sometimes rewards are not instantaneous, and it takes time, compared to coding and data science profile. If you are not enjoying the thing after few years, you will be burdened with your job in the core sector. You have to be confident that you can do this particular thing.'),

Once you are ready with it, it will help you achieve the goal most efficiently. Consult seniors who are at the top in their respective field. It would help if you tried to explore different domains. Try to make a good CV. Try to have a CG of above 8.'),
(401, 60, 'Message for Junta', 'What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them?', 'Have a good command of one particular language so that you can sit and qualify tests. Have a bit of coding background. Work on soft skills as it will matter in the interview as you have completed the technical round. When it comes to selecting between 2 or 3 candidates or in GD session, it will just be the soft skill the way you interact and communicate. Not having good soft skills affects selection a lot in GD and HR rounds. Your CV shouldn’t shout you want to do a PhD. Your statements shouldn’t be contradictory. It would help if you were very firm on what you say. That’s all from my side.'),
(411, 39, 'General Interview Process', 'What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, timeline, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you interviewed for?', 'In P&G, the first round of elimination was an online test, which can be divided into two broad categories. The first half included a personality questionnaire which consisted of about 70 to 80 questions. This part was tricky as questions assessing the same personality trait were repeated several times to see if you are answering honestly. The trick is to answer genuinely because P&G is a company which essentially looks for cultural fit more than anything else. The second part of the online test consisted of three rounds, which would assess your memory, speed and aptitude. The first round tested your mathematical aptitude, for example, you were given a mathematical equation with some blanks and you had to fill them. In the second round, they would show you some dots in a specific pattern and you would have to memorize and repeat the sequence later on. The third round was also a memory-based test. I couldn’t find anything on the internet that would give an idea of how the tests are exactly, but I guess once you start giving the test you will have a much clearer idea about how to go about those questions. It requires basic mental maths, no preparations required as such. This was conducted towards the end of November, after which around 16–18 people were shortlisted. The next round was a group interview, which happened on day minus one. They interview three people at once, the same question is posed to everyone and their answers are compared with the group. Nothing they ask would be something that goes out of your CV. For example, they asked me to give an instance of me leading a junior team, so you have to take points out of your CV or out of your life to answer the questions. They wouldn’t be asking any technical details unless you cite a relevant instance while answering. The bottom line is, they check on your CV while assessing your cultural fit for the company. On the final day of placement, a personal interview was conducted which was quite similar to the previous day group interview, except for the fact that on the final day we were given situations and were asked how we would respond to that situation. For example, the question posed to me was that imagine yourself working on a project for two weeks and being on the verge of making a big breakthrough. The day before your final presentation manager tells you that you can’t work on this project anymore, we have got a new project and you will have to start working on that. How will you respond to that? What’s more important for you, something you have worked on for two weeks or something new that comes on your way? Another question was about me coming up with an innovative cost-cutting solution using cutting edge technology for your company, but the officers you have are resistive about it, how would you go about proposing your solution and convincing them to follow your approach. Now the answers to these types of questions are purely subjective, but it is always a good practice to back up your opinion with profound examples from your work life so that they know that you lead by example and not by words.'),

Speaking for my department you should study Heat transfer, Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics. If you have less time on your hand I would suggest you go by the questions that have been asked in the previous years, and then prepare the subjects according to that. While preparing for these topics a student should focus more on the real-life applications of these topics. The interviewers won’t ask for derivations or formulas but how those concepts work in real life. Preparing by explaining to your peers would be the best bet. Apart from that, one should also practice basic aptitude, logical reasoning and data interpretation questions once in a day as they occupy a sizable portion of the initial tests conducted.'),
(413, 39, 'Advice for second years aspiring for core.', 'So, how can students in second-year start preparing for getting a job in the core, how should they build their profile for core jobs?', 'So if you are preparing for core sector, apart from having a strong grip on the subjects you would have to back it up with the internships you have done in the core sectors and to get those internships you would have to have experience on your CV to justify yourself as an asset. So what you can do is to take up a project in the department you are interested in. You should talk to your seniors about your interests and take their inputs while taking up a project under a professor. Gain some expertise and then include that in your resume while applying for internships. As for how a student should go about applying for internships, there is a three-step process that I recommend to people. The first one is to approach your contacts, if you know somebody who is there in a company relevant to your interest, then ask him about the role, send him your resume and see if that works out. The second step is to approach your warm contacts. The warm contacts would include your seniors, the alumni, the mentors that you have, talk to them about the internships they did and if you find that interesting get the contact details and mail your resume to them. The third part would be cold mailing in which you mail to HR of different companies. In short, it’s projects, internships and a good CGPA.'),
(414, 39, 'Does CGPA matter.', 'So CGPA does matter for getting jobs in the core sector?', 'Having a good CGPA never hurts, and of course, having a lower CGPA has its consequences, because most of the companies do keep a CGPA threshold.

If yes, how did you manage time for preparation between them?', 'Thankfully I had an option where I could go for consulting and I was preparing for that along with my core. As you must be aware that for consulting we have to do case preparations with your peers, so I used to do one or two cases in a day, that would take about 2–3 hrs for me. The case-solving was something I used to do post-dinner along with solving one CAT Mock paper every day, specifically the LR and DI portion, to ramp up my aptitude and accuracy. In the final year, you have a lot of free periods between the classes, so in these free periods, I used to prepare for the core subjects.'),

The only thing that matters according to me is that whatever you do in college do it with all your heart. Don’t let the position define you, you define the position you have taken.

And now, after my PPO, I have been offered a role in the Operations function of AB InBev. My job profile is of that of an Analyst in operations. And if you speak about the different companies that one may target in the FMCG sector, I would like to mention that there are a couple of companies that arrive on Day 1 or Day2, like ITC, HUL, P&G. P&G, however, is a new addition and didn’t hire for internships during my time. Another set of firms which offer operations roles are different start-ups such as Blackbuck, Oyo and Udaan.'),

After a preliminary test, 50–60 students were shortlisted and divided into groups of 10, for a group interview round. Now, group interviews are not exactly like group discussions, but more like an interview taken in a group as the name suggests. Everyone was asked about their strengths, their weaknesses and other basic interview questions. Interviewees were also asked to elaborate and discuss the points that they were putting forward. After the group interview, around 10 candidates were shortlisted and interviewed, and out of this, 50–70% of them were selected for the final offers in 2018–19 and 2019–20.

They also ask some basic questions about the company apart from these. In the final interview round, the set of questions varied from person to person. AB InBev was actually trying to select people on the basis of the projects that they had mentioned in their CV. One of my friends was asked questions only on Data Science because he was aiming for a Data Scientist role. He was asked technical questions purely on Data Science. Another one of my friends was aiming for a more supply chain and logistics oriented job, so he was asked questions based on that. I was more inclined towards innovation and operations, so I was asked questions from that domain. One important thing to notice is that this was possible only because the firm already had projects in all these sectors — operations, supply chain, data science, DevOps.'),
(421, 38, 'Preparation strategy', 'What was your preparation strategy?', 'Everyone has their own style of preparation. When I was preparing, I focused more on an Analyst type of role, where one should have a clear understanding of the mathematics and the statistics involved. In big firms, the interviewers basically focus on your process of solving the question. Your thinking process matters a lot. And if you want to go for an operations role, everything depends on your CV and you should be able to defend everything that you put on it. This is because operations is not a very technical role. It is mostly about the experiences you’ve gained on campus, and how your contributions would help the firm grow.

The number of offers will probably be lesser due to obvious reasons. But, the students should not lose hope. Be more proficient in communication, because they most probably will have an online interview where it is very important to communicate well. If you are not able to explain your idea to the person on the screen in front of you, then it won’t even matter if you have the best CV out there. So, for this scenario, I would suggest people focus a lot on their soft skills. Try to do mock interviews on video calls and phone calls to get some practice before an actual interview. This will help you understand what kind of pressure you will be facing, or what kind of problems you can face during a video call. Prepare for at least two different types of roles and make a proper CV specific to those roles. Don’t underrate the HR round. Also, there is nothing to worry about if your internship stands cancelled for this year, or there is a gap in your CV for summers 2019–20 because companies do understand that. Do not panic. It is important to contact as many seniors as possible, get your CV reviewed and prepare yourself to anticipate the questions that could be asked.'),

ITC first circulates a questionnaire which has around 10–11 questions related to academic profile, internships, projects, PORs and others are HR questions. Based on the answers we gave and the CV around 50 students were shortlisted which was then followed by a psychometric test, this test tests the cultural fit of a candidate, there are no right or wrong answers here, then we had a Group Discussion round which was followed by 2 rounds of personal interview. The first round of personal interview was more technical and there were a wide range of questions based on core chemical engineering concepts and their real-life applications and also some technical questions from my internships and projects. They almost covered everything that was mentioned in my CV. After clearing the technical round there was the HR round. The technical round is to check the competency of the candidate, and the HR round is to check the compatibility and the cultural fit of the candidate.'),

You should be able to answer every question that is asked regarding your projects, internships, POR’s, extra academics or anything that is mentioned in your CV, and for specifically chemical engineering students I would say that you should brush up on your knowledge of heat transfer, fluid mechanics, mass transfer, a bit of thermodynamics and working of pumps. The questions are not very difficult rather they are based on the practical applications of what we have studied like it could be as simple as asking why does the flow area of water falling out from a tap changes, so you should be able to answer the theory behind any such phenomena.'),

They just want to learn about your background, your ability to think on your feet, how you present your view and whether you would be a good cultural fit or not. In my opinion, the best way to prepare for HR round is to recall your past experiences which you think might be relevant and whenever a related question is asked you should be able to tell them such experiences to justify your answers, for example, I was asked if I am capable of putting my mind over matter I simply talked about an instance from my tenure as the Overall Events Coordinator of Spring Fest.

The process for Mckinsey and Dalberg starts with a test unlike that of BCG, post which there is a round of CV Shortlisting in all the consulting firms. This is followed by two sets of interview rounds. The first one is with Project Leaders or Associate Partners in the firm and the second one is usually with Partners. If we talk specifically about McKinsey, they usually release a shortlist of 15 to 20 students based on the CV of the applicants. The shortlisted students have to undergo a test which is a one-of-a-kind animated online simulation game and it is non-eliminatory. This is succeeded by two rounds of interviews in which one would usually interact with 2–3 different interviewers in each round.'),

Until last year, McKinsey took a problem-solving test that checked the mental ability and basic math of the applicants, but this year they introduced a game which tests one’s planning, strategy and time management skills. After that, we had two rounds (or sets) of Interviews. The first set consisted of two interviews with an engagement manager and an associate partner of the firm. The second set consisted of three interviews with partners. Usually, every interview consists of two sections — Personal experience interview and a Case interview. In a personal experience interview, they try to learn your experiences, understand your personality and whether or not you will fit into the firm. For example, I was asked about any experience I had in conflict resolution, they asked about the challenges I faced in my internships and positions of responsibility, and so forth. In a case interview, they ask you to solve either a case study and/or a guesstimate. They ask you to solve it with them in a duration of 20 mins (typically) to test your structuring, critical thinking and strategizing skills.'),

One is case studies and the other is personality experience. You should work towards developing a profile with “spikes”. For the Interview, it typically only takes 40 days of Preparation, so I recommend focusing less on the interview from early on and rather use that time in building a good profile. So, how to get shortlisted? You need to have a good Profile — PORs, internships, FT if possible, Competitions, Extracurriculars and most importantly, a good CGPA. Chances increase exponentially when it is more than 8 or 8.5. Good Internship further backs it up. If you don’t have a good internship then try to get a good FT during the break. You can participate in a lot of competitions, which is also a spike to have on your CV. Also, PORs help a lot in articulating answers in the personal experience interview. All being said, you need to have a wholesome profile or something extraordinary in your CV to distinguish yourself from the other applicants.'),

Then start by making a good CV and a cover letter. Approach as many seniors as possible and take suggestions on making your CV better. The CV should ideally focus on your strengths and what you want them to know about you. For preparation, the most important thing is having a good case group and Seniors and who can help you. While making a case group, be sure to make it with people who would be blatantly honest with you and share honest feedback, and are as enthusiastic as you. After a while (about 3 weeks of prep), it is good to start solving cases with seniors and other case groups. That will help you understand any mistakes that you are not aware of and in general boost your confidence. Students usually neglect the personal experience interview but please don’t take it casually. Practise for those questions too on a daily basis during your prep. Put forward your thoughts confidently and in a well-structured way. In the end, I would say that this preparation will never be a waste. It is definitely going to help you get better at your interview skills, improve your thought process and your communication. It will definitely go a long way, no matter the outcome.'),

Here, we present you a glimpse of the brief interaction we had with her. We thank her for spending her valuable time with us for the same. So, Sreelatha, What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'Well, I did not sit for many companies during my internship process. Amongst the few were L.E.K. The general interview process for companies is CV submission, then GD, and then PI. Since this is a management consulting company, we had preliminary screening by CV shortlisting after which we had a workshop followed by rounds of buddy sessions and case interviews. We participated in about 3 buddy sessions per person and 2–3 rounds of interviews each. The workshop conducted for two days was very useful where the seniors explained the interview process, what case interviews entail, preparation practices, etc. In the interview process, we had case questions, guesstimates, and HR rounds.'),
(472, 10, 'Questions asked in different rounds', 'Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'Typical questions of case interviews can be divided into three parts: one is guesstimates which are estimation questions on various topics, the second is a typical case interview and the third is a personal interview. An estimation question is solved using analytical skills and superficial assumptions. The aim of the interviewer is to check your analytical skills and finding out numerically an estimate of a particular number related to a category. For example, they could ask you something as simple as to estimate the number of smartphones in India. One can the following simple process to go about it: what is the population of India, then segregating the population based on say rural-urban localities, gender, age, income groups, internet penetration in different areas and in general phone penetration and usage penetration. So, the idea is you have to understand which factors play in your calculations at what stage and the goal is to arrive at the number of smartphones. The above is an example and there can be varied questions here: the number of petrol pumps in a region, the number of leaves in a forest, etc. Number two is the case interview. There are two types of case interviews that people typically ask at an undergraduate level: one is a simple profitability case, so in a profitability case, for example, say a company XYZ is facing a decline in profit in the past two to three years, so your problem statement is to identify why. The interview is a very interactive discussion where you ask your interviewer questions and they provide you requisite details to help outline and narrow down your hypothesis to arrive at an answer. The interviewee is advised to follow a structured flowchart and ask the relevant questions at different stages and try to outline what factor/s is causing this decline in profits. Usually, case questions are followed by suggestions as to how we can overcome the given problem. These are extremely dependent on the candidate itself and a good analysis with further segmentation can get you brownie points! The second type of question is a market entry case. Say a company XYZ wants to enter the retail industry or a company operating in XYZ country wants to enter the market of another country. The interviewee analyses different aspects including the barriers of entry, mode of entry, profitability, risks, etc. and presents a solution. Again, this is a very interactive interview where at each step you ask the interviewer the right questions and streamline your hypothesis.'),
(473, 10, 'FAQs', 'What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'In the PI section for L.E.K. Consulting, the aim of the questions is to get to know the interviewee better. Topics of discussion include past work explanation, extracurricular activities, motivations, achievements, etc; Since consulting firms hire from all departments, a few aspects for the students to note: Understand each and every aspect of your previous experiences — you should be able to explain it in the most granular way possible — details, impact, etc. So, CV preparation is very important. Besides this, questions include career goals, expectations from this internship, motivation to be a consultant, knowledge about consulting, why do you think you are a good fit for this industry, and so on.'),
(474, 10, 'Suggestions for students sitting for placements', 'What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector?', 'So the first and foremost thing I can say is that you have to start preparing from as early as possible because case preparation can take about one to two months. There are a few steps you can follow. The first thing is to start preparing your CV as off-campus placements start very early on the campus and before your summer vacation gets over you should be ready with your first draft. Proceed to get it checked by as many seniors as possible, preferably in the industry, department, seniors who know you to optimize it so that you can present it in the best possible way. The announcement of the interview process happens only 10–15 days before the schedule. So you have to start preparing as early as you can. Material for preparation is easily available — Drive folders with relevant books and useful websites. Any senior who has undergone the process can easily point you to them. One starter useful resource is Victor Cheng’s videos. They give a brief overview before you can take up case interview books. Preparation is better done in groups of 3 to 4 people. Join efforts with your friends, preferably with diverse opinions. A diligent schedule of mock cases and guesstimates can help you keep track easily. As I have mentioned before, case interviews are very interactive. The interviewer and the interviewee have an active discussion with each other so when you prepare for interviews it’s best to replicate this process with your friends.One person can be an interviewer, second can be an interviewee and the third person in the case group can be a passive audience who can note down and tell you what points you can improve upon. I would also suggest people record your interviews and iterate on improvements in presentation, vocabulary, etc. So in this way you can conduct mock interviews amongst yourselves and improve your performance! Focus on improving your analytical skills and speed in maintaining multiple trains of thought. More practice can help familiarise you with a variety of questions and boost your confidence in the interview process.'),

For Tata Projects, in the Technical round, I was asked a very basic Civil Engineering Question: What is known as the pre and post-tensioning of beams? followed by questions on my internships and CV. For the Technical round, you should only have a good knowledge of your departmental courses. I did not have an HR round for Tata Projects, they had only one round. For other companies, there were basic HR questions asking you about your family, about your background, strengths and weaknesses, what you did at KGP and how it has helped and shaped you etc.'),

A lot of people go for further studies as well, so that further reduces the number of applicants for core companies.'),
(482, 32, 'Resources', 'What were the resources that you had used to prepare for the company?

Most seniors I contacted had advised me to start Data and Coding, but a few of them advised me something which I would definitely like to advise my juniors. Start discarding profiles that you don’t want to work in. Instead of thinking of what you want, you should clearly know what you don’t want to do. And this helped me a lot, I starting discarding profiles that I didn’t want to work in and soon, I found a natural pool for myself. There are not many companies for core, and there is not much preparation required for core, so you can always prepare for other profiles like Consult and Operations in my case.'),

During the placement time, try taking a step backwards and think if you really want to do what you are doing or it’s just due to peer pressure. You will be tempted to take the easy way out like taking up data as everybody does in the last two months. Don’t give in to the pressure of placements. It’s a beautiful process. Go through with it.

I realized that I did not enjoy it as much as other people. Around that time, in the beginning of second year,we had our departmental courses start, and I realised that I was enjoying studying my departmental courses and that my first impressions of Chemical Engineering were overall positive. I took up a project in my department at the end of my 3rd semester, and by the end of my second year I realized that we have a lot of opportunities in the core field too. Come placement semester, I was more or less certain I could see myself working in this field on a long term basis. Since I was already devoted to core, I did not think that I should go into ML or data analytics.'),

For core, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, mass transfer etc. are pretty elementary courses which we have here in second year as well as third year but these are courses that will continue to be important throughout and are especially important for core internships and placements. Even in the final year placement interviews or vivas, people continue to ask questions from fluid mechanics,heat transfer and Thermodynamics. In my internship interview which I did at ITC, my entire interview was based on questions of heat transfer because it is one of the most integral concepts if you want to work in an industry. In my placement interview my entire interview was based around my project which I did as an intern at ITC and on any one subject of my choice. People should ideally choose these core basic subjects because they are absolutely fundamental and be absolutely thorough with them. As a brownie point, try and research on industrial applications of the concepts you’ve learned, which really impresses the interviewers.'),
(488, 33, 'Importance of CG for Core Profile', 'Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when their CG is high, what is going to be your comment on this.', 'It is not about CGPA in my opinion, but about whether you actually want to pursue a career in the core field, i.e. if you actually like the core field. If you do like your departmental field, you will have a CGPA good enough to sit in a core field. CGPA is an important factor, no doubt. Having a good CG is important. The better the CGPA, the higher are your chances of selection. A CG of above 8.3+ is a safe bet for core placements, but if you have a very high CGPA and a very research oriented profile, companies might think you’ll go on for higher studies and not want to take you on and you’ll have your work cut out to convince them otherwise. The ideal CGPA range would be 8.3–9.3. However it’s not like if a person has a low CG then there is nothing left. There is a chance in core even if you have a low CG. I know some of my batchmates who got shortlisted and also selected in core companies with a 7.X CGPA'),

The only preparation you can have is to have a good grasp of basic core concepts. It was also one of my favourite tests of the CDC placement processes. Come December, there is a GD which is very technical and will test you to the very maximum on your core subject competencies. Before the process, it is best to revise all of your subjects because you’ll be tested on each and every one of them. Following that, there was only one interview round which involves questions on your past internships, projects and some questions on a few core concepts. There were also a few basic HR questions.'),
(490, 33, 'Resources', 'So any resources you would like to mention which you used for preparing?', 'As far as the test is concerned, I can just say be attentive in classes, do a reading of what you’ve studied before the test and keep everything at the back of your head because you cannot really be prepared enough for any test. For the interview I’ll suggest, be very strong on your basic concepts and basic courses like fluid mechanics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, mass transfer. Most of the interviews will revolve around that and be extremely thorough with whatever internships or whatever projects you have done, because they will grill you a lot on that. The basic thumb rule in any interview process is, be very well versed with your CV, you should be able to justify every single point that you have on your CV. Another good interview strategy is to go through your CV, and try and predict what questions could be asked from each line of your CV. That way, you generally already have the answers to most of the questions that will be asked, and you don’t leave things to chance.'),

(492, 33, 'Preparation strategy', ' So what were your strategies for your preparations? Did you change it depending on which company you’re aiming for or in between the rounds?', ' No.I mean I did not apply for a lot of companies.I think one of the mistakes that people do is they apply for every company.I was surely selective in what companies I would apply for. I applied for a few Day 1 companies, and the mainly for core companies that were coming from Day 2 onwards. I had a few shortlists on day-2.1 but I decided to skip them because I wanted to give Dr.REDDY’s interview as if I had been selected for anyone of one of them then I would not have been able to sit for Dr.REDDY’s. I think it’s important that before the placements you must be clear on what companies you need to prioritize. If there are companies coming slightly later and if you think you have a really good chance of getting in and you don’t want to go to the company which comes earlier,I think you should wait for it, be confident in your preparation and you will get what you want.'),

It is most important to not get scared, and not get anxious and depressed if you do not get a day 1 placement, because there are a lot of companies that come later, some with better salary packages too. Not getting a day 1 placement is not the end of the world, prepare well, be confident and give your best, good things will definitely follow. I would also say that ask seniors who have gone through placements for any help you might need, because one thing that I’ve learnt in KGP is that your seniors are always there to help you. They have gone through the incredibly stressful time that you would go through in a few months, and will be able to give you incredibly composed advice (I was able to talk with a senior of mine even at 5 AM for help during placements!). Put your best foot forward, and all the best for the upcoming placements semester!'),

Moreover, these projects are typically in different global locations.'),
(496, 34, 'Selection process', 'Could you please describe in brief about the selection process for the company?', 'Firstly, candidates submit their CV on the CDC portal on the ERP based on which there is an initial shortlisting. Post a psychometric test; a questionnaire is floated on the programme’s website. This is evaluated to release the final shortlist for campus group discussion rounds. These candidates are also allotted buddies who are currently future leaders. Buddies can be contacted for information regarding the program and advice regarding the interviews. The remainder of the process is the Group Discussion, and Personal Interview held on campus.'),
(497, 34, 'Interview process', 'That was a long process for selection. Could you please tell us more about the questionnaire?', 'The questionnaire has questions regarding campus life, critical takeaways from internship experiences and career goals. The questionnaire is different in the sense that you are expected to write answers that reflect who you are as a person. My advice would be to be as open and reflective as possible and leave out the generic answers students generally prepare for HR interviews.'),
(498, 34, 'Prepration tips for GD', 'Is there any specific process or method that you would recommend for preparing for the GD (Group Discussion)?', 'My Group discussion topic was non-technical (and I think it was that way for all the groups). The topic was open-ended, and the discussion too was such. I do not feel preparation is required for such topics, though mock discussions with peers will help with expressing thoughts well and maintaining a good flow. My advice would be to stay as coherent as possible and work well with your group. Adding analysis to points being discussed and bringing new aspects to the discussion is a plus.'),
(499, 34, 'Interview process', 'So could you talk about how your interview went after getting shortlisted from the GD round?', 'The interview experience was excellent since it was an amicable conversation and not a grilling session that candidates expect. It is more of a fit interview, and I would advise being honest and clear about yourself. The questions tend to be far more personal than the regular placement interview and having some clarity with regards to learnings from experiences in and beyond campus life as well as some serious thought given future goals and ambitions might prove helpful.'),
(500, 34, 'Questions related to personal life', 'Thanks Raj for sharing your insights about the GD round. According to you, what is the best way to handle questions related to personal life?', ' Your answers should reflect the kind of person you are, and ideally be supported by evidence from your experiences. For example, internship experiences need not be limited to the technical expertise acquired, but also to the experiences gained outside work hours; campus life need not be limited to projects undertaken or posts held but also your hobbies and extracurriculars and so on.'),
(501, 34, 'Case round or a sort of guesstimate round', 'Okay Raj. Did you face anything like a case round or a sort of guesstimate round?', 'There were no case rounds or guesstimates in the entire process. However, practising cases helps in structuring your thoughts and putting them forward in a concise manner, which would benefit candidates in an interview. I was lucky to have a fantastic case group, with super friendly people who helped me through the process and made it a lot of fun.'),
(502, 34, 'General Fundae for KGP Junta', 'Okay Raj. We have reached the end of the interview. As you have graduated from IIT Kharagpur, are there any fundae that you want to share with your juniors for placement preparation and their life at KGP?', 'Many students do not have clarity on their field of interest or the domain they would like to pursue as their career. Please remember it is alright to be confused. Keep trying different areas; knowing what you do not like is also progress. Nalanda is full of opportunities during the placement process and approaching each opportunity with an open mind helps. Avoiding companies due to pre-conceived notions will only reduce opportunities. I had discussions with my seniors who advised me on company-specific as well as general preparation. The placement process is very tedious but help from my friends. Both batchmates and juniors made it more comfortable and I think this is the crucial ingredient to placements along with preparation. As far as life on campus is concerned, I feel saying yes to opportunities as they come by is very important and will help you grow as a person. It is a great time to explore what you like and should be utilized to the fullest. Time spent overthinking should be gladly diverted and spent enjoying with friends. Cheers!'),

So we are here to interview him regarding his preparations and strategies to crack the interview of this company. So firstly could you explain to us about your role in the company?', 'Hello everyone. My role at Nestle is a Technical Leadership Program in the field of Food Processing. I will handle manufacturing, and this includes an initial training period followed by leading technical projects related in the various factories across the country. By the end of my 2nd year, I was very clear about my interest and the food processing space and knew that I want to pursue my career in this field.'),
(504, 35, 'General Interview Process', ' Ok Parush. Now could you brief us about the interview process?', 'There were 3 stages of the interview, the first one was CV shortlisting. Since I was sure what I wanted to pursue, I had built my profile accordingly, which included multiple internships in the food sector across the value chain, and this helped a lot in getting shortlisted for the job. The shortlisted candidates from the Food process engineering specialization of Agricultural and Food Engineering department with profiles which aligned with their job requirements for the Technical Leadership program. The second round was a general group discussion round. The third round was the Personal Interview(PI) round.'),
(505, 35, 'Shortlisting and GD round', 'Ok Parush. Could you tell us about the shortlisting and GD round?', 'The candidates were shortlisted completely on the basis of CV and there were no CGPA criteria. In GD round, from a group of 10- 15 members, 4–5 members were shortlisted. The topic was very generic and in my case, it was “The rise of the e-commerce industry is impacting the businesses of the retailers/brick-and-mortar stores.”'),
(506, 35, 'PI Round', 'Ok Parush. Could you brief us about the PI round?', 'The PI round was classified into 3 broad categories apart from the beginning introductory questions. The first round of questions was from my internships. They delved deeper into the technical details of the work that I did during my internships. The 2nd round of questions was related to the course curriculum. These included courses that were relevant to the food processing sector, such as basics of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics and other departmental food courses. The questions were very basic as they wanted to understand the clarity of concepts. The 3rd round was based on leadership abilities and extra-curricular activities. It was more of a situation-based scenario.'),
(507, 35, 'Depth knowledge of each topic or having an overview', 'Ok Parush. For the core field, is it more important to have in-depth knowledge of each topic or having an overview is fine?', 'In the interview, they asked me about my favourite topics and the interview continued with that topic. So you should have a brief overview of everything that you’ve studied and detailed understanding of the topics that you’re comfortable with.'),
(508, 35, 'Importance of POR Work', 'Ok Parush. So coming to the PORs, is the no. of PORs more important or the work we have done in the POR is more important?', 'Well both have their own importance. While CV shortlisting, they may consider the number of PORs while in the PI round, things will change and they will be asking about the work you’ve done and how it has shaped you. You need to show that you’ve driven a significant impact wherever you’ve worked. Similarly, in the CV as well, you need to highlight the impact that you’ve created while you held the responsibility.'),
(509, 35, 'CAT Preparation along side interview preparation', 'Ok Parush. Could you please guide us how an individual can prepare for CAT along with the interview preparation?', 'I was preparing for placement in the core field right from my first year so I didn’t have to go out of my way to work for this. I had been performing well academically, and I made sure that I could grasp whatever knowledge I could during my internships. Coming to the courses, you can revise them a couple of days before the interview. So in the placement semester, I used most of my time and energy for the CAT preparation.'),
(510, 35, 'General Fundae for KGP Junta', 'Thank you Parush for all the valuable information. We have reached the end of the interview. Is there any message you want to give to the juniors of KGP?', 'Yeah, it will help more if you participate in a lot of activities in your UG curriculum. Explore more in the first year. In the second year, figure out what you want. In 3rd year, you should know what to pursue. By 4th year you should have expertise in that field and find opportunities where your passion lies. While a lot of people sideline academics, I think it’s super important to have a good CG because I think that’s something that will help you wherever you go.'),
(511, 11, 'Nature of the interview process', 'Mr Chandar Siddarth from IIT Kharagpur has previously done an internship in L.E.K. Consulting as a Summer Associate and also got a PPO from L.E.K. Consulting. Communiqué IIT Kharagpur interacted with him on the interview process and the strategy he adopted for its preparation. Here, we present you a glimpse of the brief interaction we had with him. We thank him for spending his valuable time with us for the same. So, Siddarth, What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'So, during my CDC internship process specifically for Consulting, I had only interviewed with L.E.K. and it is the only firm that comes to the campus for CDC internship. I interviewed with only this and I got selected for the internship. There were two rounds specifically. In order to qualify for these two rounds, you have to upload your CV on the portal. The first basis of shortlisting is CV shortlisting so they look for the points in your CV in the first stage. After shortlisting, about 20 to 40 people are selected depending on the quality of the CV’s. Then these selected people go for the first round. The first round is usually a guesstimate round, it’s a common consulting interview process where you are asked to estimate something. For example, the number of cars in India or it can be estimating the number of taxis in a city like Mumbai or it can be the number of ping pong balls you can fit in a room and so on. So, there is a set process as to how you arrive at your answer and that’s a guesstimate round for about 15 to 20 minutes. It is largely problem-based, there are not many HR questions in the first round. The second round was a case interview. A case interview is something which is a very common round in consulting-based interviews. This round involves business problems that your interviewer asks you and you discuss with your interviewer to potentially arrive at a solution at the end of the interview. A lot of things matter in a case interview, your analytical skills and your communication skills are the most important in my opinion. Those were the two rounds specifically that I had to be the part of in order to get selected for the internship.'),
(512, 11, 'Questions asked in different rounds', 'Could you please list down questions that were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'Interviewing for a consulting firm is not like interviewing for any technical firm. There are quite a lot of differences. Firstly, you will not be asked simple questions which you can answer in two-three lines. Like in technical rounds you might be asked how to write the shortest code for a particular sort of problem or how to solve a particular linked list problem, what is the best algorithm to do so etc. Something like this is asked, multiple questions having short answers. But this doesn’t happen in consulting interviews. What ends up happening is that the entire interview consists of one problem. The conversation may last up to 40 or 45 minutes. For example, they can ask you that a random shoe company like Nike or Adidas has seen losses in a particular quarter of the year let’s say particularly in Asia. They will ask you to find out why and what you can do to improve revenue for the next quarter. Now, this is how broad the problem statement will be. So, it is like doing a case study live one on one with your interviewer. So what you will be doing is you will be looking for different areas where there could be potential problems as to why the revenue was falling, why the company was facing losses and then you will finally zeroing one or more causes for the problem and you would use your creativity and common knowledge to find out potential solutions that you can implement to get rid of these problems over the course of time in the next quarter. This entire process will take a lot of time because there are a lot of things to consider when it comes to finding out what is actually causing the problem that your client has. There is a systematic way to proceed from like top to bottom. We usually call it ME-CE(Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive) which means you are looking at different aspects of the cause and these aspects are exclusive from each other like you are not looking at the same thing over and over again. Together all of these things, these multiple parts are exhaustive. The idea is to go down to the depths of each potential cause and find out where the problem is. So, the problem statement can largely vary from interviewer to interviewer. It really depends on the interviewer as to what they have prepared to ask. It takes nearly 20 to 45 minutes, sometimes even up to an hour.'),
(513, 11, 'FAQs', 'What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'So especially for consulting, HR is not a separate round usually unless it’s very close between you and somebody and there might be an extra HR round or something like that. The usual purpose of HR in a technical company or software development profile is to find out how good you are in communicating and how good you will fit into a team. This is what is evaluated in the HR round. But since the nature of the consulting interviews itself involves a lot of communication, this is sort of integrated into the process itself. So, a consulting interview, mainly, a case interview will have a lot of emphasis on analysing and evaluating your communication skills as well as part of the interviewer’s job. So, the interviewer is looking at how good you are at communicating as well. So that is something, that is evaluated as the part of the case interview itself and that is precisely why there isn’t a need for an extra HR round. However, in your case interview round, they might have a conversation with you before or after the case for let’s say like 10 or 15 minutes just to get to know what kind of a person you are. This is usually considered to be the HR component of a consulting interview. This is not very long, usually kept very brief and it involves things like what is your motivation behind applying to consulting or why do you want to get into consulting or why specifically X or Y or Z firm, why do you want to apply to our firm and general questions like what are your strengths, what are your weaknesses, show us an example of a leadership quality that you demonstrated in the time in college and also the questions pertaining to your CV that you submitted before, so they might ask you questions from you CV. For example, if you did an internship at an ABC company, then they might ask you to explain any problem or crisis that you solved during your internship at ABC company. So, the HR part of the consulting interview itself is very brief and maximum lasts for about 15 minutes and as I said most of the questions of these questions are standard ones and the subjective ones could be the ones from your CV.'),
(514, 11, 'Suggestions for students sitting for placements', 'What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector?', 'In the present kind of scenario (considering COVID-19 pandemic), there is a lot of uncertainty in the market, in general, in the job industry specifically. Consulting is not a sector this is a personal informed opinion. Consulting is not a sector that should be massively affected because it employees highly trained professionals and have a limited number of employees. It basically functions on the number of employees it has and it is not a mass recruiting firm like it does not recruit thousands of employees in a particular country like how a technical firm would need. So, it should not be an industry that is affected massively, however, what will be affected is the timeline of the interviews and timeline of the recruitment process this particular year. Usually the process for consulting interviews, specifically for placements happens much before December. It happens around the month of July, August and September. It can move a little forward or backwards so it can start from August and go on to September, October or it can be July, August and September. This is the usual case but this year I think it will be further extended by quite a bit. It might start as late as October or November and might coincide with the actual placement process that happens in December. So, the major companies that come for consult placements are Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey and Company, EY Parthenon Group and specifically L.E.K. Consulting Group in the context of IIT Kharagpur. These companies currently because of COVID-19, they may not be able to carry out their recruitment process like they usually do. The consult timeline would be pushed back quite a bit. So, what students can do right now since they have a lot of free time, they can prepare for case interviews. This is something they can do because of extended summer vacations as well. What they can do is they can prepare for case interviews really well right from the get-go. So usually, students end up coming back to campus and forming their case groups and start preparing for the case interviews. You need somebody else to prepare with, you can not prepare by yourself because one person places the interviewer and the other person place the interviewee and it’s mutual so if I and X person form a case group, I’ll be the interviewer for one case and they’ll be the interviewer for one case, so we’ll do it alternatively so that both of us can practise. In the present situation, because of social distancing, we can not do it in person, however, we have access to skype and other platforms, we can do it online and we have a lot of time right now. As the consult timeline is going to get postponed you will have more time to prepare well so that’s a good thing. Practice is a sure short way to clear the case interview. The more practise you have, the more likely you will do well in the interview process itself.'),
(515, 11, 'Preparation for technical rounds', 'How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted?', 'In my particular case, it was the internship season so I was not sitting for placements. My year was the first year, L.E.K. Consulting decided to come for internships. There was no concept of pre-final year’s preparing for consulting before. So usually the final years have formed the case groups and were preparing for consulting interviews simply because consulting interviews only happened for placements, not for internships. However, in my year L.E.K. decided to come for CDC internships. I was not very sure about my shortlist itself. So, once I had known that I had got shortlisted based on my CV, I had formed a case group. It was pretty late, but I had formed a case group then and I prepared pretty rigorously for about 2 weeks doing cases with that person before the interviews started. So, in those two weeks, my preparation was solely focused on gearing myself up to do really well in case interviews and guesstimates. I practised many case interviews and guesstimates with my partner from multiple sources. As I said in my answer to the previous question right now there are about like 5 to 6 months before you get to have your interview, so if you are really looking towards consulting and you think your CV has a good chance of getting shortlisted then you should definitely start preparing now.'),
(516, 11, 'General Funda', 'Anything else that you would want to share with the students?', 'So consulting is not for everybody. It might look like a very interesting or very happening field but it comes with pros and cons. Make sure you research about what consulting is and whether it is something that would suit the kind of a person you are because you may not end up liking it after you get into it so this is the thing I really want to tell students. At least if somebody wants to explore consulting they should try doing an internship in consulting before getting placed in consulting directly because once you get placed it’s your job, you can’t change it at least for a year and if you don’t like it, then you won’t be happy and this is not something you will look forward to. So, what I would say is talk to seniors who already worked in consulting and find out whether it will suit you or not, another way as I said, go for an internship first to see if it suits you or not. All consulting firms irrespective of whether it is for internships or placements, the first step is CV shortlisting, so make sure your CV is made really well. The chances of getting shortlisted are directly proportional to how your CV is. Once you get shortlisted, start preparing well for the interview.'),
(517, 11, 'Expressing Gratitude ', 'Thank you Siddarth for giving your precious time for this interview to Communiqué IIT Kharagpur. I hope your interview will help students in their future endeavours.', 'Thank You'),
(518, 68, 'Interview process', 'Hi everyone, we have Aarushi Gupta today, who recently got placed at Dalberg. So Aarushi, I will be asking you a couple of questions regarding the strategies to crack the interviews of consulting companies. What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Also, please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'Well, I interviewed only for Dalberg. We started with a primary shortlist round; there were around 40 people. And after that, we had a test. About 12–13 people appeared for the test. Then we had a buddy session; there was a buddy assigned to all of us from Dalberg itself. So this buddy round went up to two weeks. My buddy did two cases with me, and she guided me on things to do. I am not exactly sure if this round is evaluated, but they help a lot. After this, we had interviews. I had four interviews conducted over two days. The first two were the senior consultant rounds, and the next two were partner rounds. The actual interview was an hour-long- 20 minutes for HR and 40 minutes for the case.'),
(519, 68, 'Questions asked', 'Okay. Moving ahead, Could you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Like the Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'Right. So all the HR questions were general. The first question is always to introduce yourself. The next they ask is why consulting. Also, why social consulting in my case and why Dalberg in particular. So these are the questions I feel are common in every interview. All they want to know is about your interest and your preparation. Apart from that, they asked about my previous internships or PORs, anything they felt was interesting in my CV. So preparing your CV well is important. In the end, their questions were a bit different like what my plans were for the next five years in the future or particular instances by giving examples a little more in detail. As for the cases, all four of them were based on development sectors on actual projects my interviewers worked on. So they didn’t have a separate questionnaire; each one of them asked something from their previous experiences. If I have to talk about the actual questions asked, the first question I was asked was the development of the economy in a small country that recently became an independent nation from South East Asia called East Timor. So the discussion went towards a direction where I had to talk about the agricultural economy and how we can boost it. The second case was about opening bank accounts for women in India and what we could do towards it, finding out particular sections of the Indian society where women aren’t opening bank accounts and are left behind. So basically, we had to come up with ways we could combat this problem. The third round was a partner round about solar lamps in India. So, they wanted to see if we could replace kerosene oil altogether with solar lamps. It was more of a guesstimate where I had to calculate the total amount of kerosene used in India and then see how solar lamps could replace it. Then my last case was also a partner round. It was about introducing educational technologies in Andhra Pradesh. They wanted to introduce a new system that would teach better in govt schools. They wanted to look into how to do it, the cost, and ways to lower the cost. These interviews did not follow a general framework, but all of them had a few quantitative elements where I had to calculate something.'),
(520, 68, 'FAQs for HR round', 'So my next question is what are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'The most frequently asked questions tell about yourself, why consulting and why that company. So these questions are to be prepared beforehand. Other questions were based on CV, and it depends on how the interview moves ahead, but these questions are asked in every interview, be it any company.'),
(521, 68, 'Advice for placements 2022', 'Okay, Aarushi, What do you think are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now on to maximize their chances of getting through a company in consulting?', 'So solving cases would help. I noticed in my Dalberg interviews that they were very off the books and did not follow a specific framework. So if you’re already familiar with the process, it becomes easy to answer every problem given to you. So practising is going to be helpful. It’s better to make a group and start practising as early as possible. Practising with others and getting ideas from someone who knows better is very important.'),
(522, 68, 'Preparation after shortlisting', 'Okay. Moving on. Please tell us how your preparation for case rounds evolved once you were shortlisted? Also, please let us know about the resources you used as well.', 'I practised with my batchmates and people around me for case rounds. Also, practising with seniors is something you should focus on to know where you’re going wrong. We used IIT Madras and IIT Bombay case books. I did cases from these books, and once I got my buddies, the format changed. I then started with cases quite different from those given in books, the development-based one. My buddy helped me understand how to approach different problems. Also, a book called “Case Interviews Secrets” by Victor Cheng gives a broad idea of what you’re supposed to do in the field.'),
(523, 68, 'Message for the Junta', 'So, now we have almost come to the end of the interview. Anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'I think preparing for HR beforehand is essential because you have to come up with something that impresses interviewers. Try interacting with the interviewers because the cases are not necessarily straightforward. So interacting is very important since they can change the flow of the entire discussion, and you have to pick up on what they’re saying and react accordingly. These are a few things that books generally don’t teach us.'),

So the specific role was for McKinsey Knowledge Center at Supply Chain Center of Competence. My interview process is divided into 3 rounds, in which includes 2 were technical and 1 was Case + HR round.'),
(526, 4, 'Nature of Questions', 'So Rohan my next question is what was the nature of questions and what were the different types of questions that were asked in the HR round?', 'On the technical side as my profile and internship profile both were on the supply chain side. It was very technical on the operations research and supply chain management related theory and how my previous internships and practical implementations have been. That was about the technical round, and there was simple case based round and the HR questions were also normal level questions.'),
(527, 4, 'Frequenly asked HR questions', 'Thanks, Rohan for letting us know. Also could you tell us, what are the questions that are frequently asked in each round which are mostly difficult for many students, specifically in HR round ?', 'I believe the major questions which were asked were related to scheduling, routing and inventory management because these are the major topics on which the project or internships depends and mostly all the interns who were with me were to be working on. So I think these are basic things that are included in each round of technical and HR round.'),
(528, 4, 'Courses of importance', 'Okay Rohan thanks for this, lets move to the next question. How did you prepare for your interview ,did you follow any resources. Also could you list the courses that would benefit the students of this field?', 'In general, my profile relates a lot to supply chain as my previous internships and publications and all my projects here at Kharagpur are related to supply chain and optimisation, also about from where students should prepare there is a course called “Logistics and Supply Chain Management” in Industrial Department whose resources are very helpful for any supply chain logistics related interviews or courses or competitions anything.'),
(529, 4, 'Suggestions', 'Thanks for your valuable information Rohan and the next question is , How to prepare for the internships during our stay at campus and how did you get prepared while you were at it.Also what are your suggestions for the students who are preparing for technical and HR rounds at present and how did you prepared yourself for technical and HR rounds?', 'So,for me it was that I had only applied to the companies which are related to supply chain and here also at McKinsey &Company I came to know that there is a team called “Supply Chain Center”. So I applied to them through “LinkedIn”. For a general preparation in supply chain you need a very specific knowledge in the field of Operations Research, Data Sciences and the general supply chain management courses like the one I mentioned before. When it comes to case interview, you have to prepare in the general way of the consultancy case interview but from different books which are provided for different companies.I recommend to all those students who are preparing for technical and HR rounds at present is, to do some courses like “Supply Chain Management” and follow the books which are recommended in this course. Generally I do not prefer reading books rather, I would prefer doing online courses regarding this field because I believe this would be more helpful than that.'),
(530, 4, 'Suggestions for 1st years', 'hanks Rohan for all your tips.The next question is, What would you like to say for the 1st years who plans to intern in McKinsey company?', 'Actually this particular zone at the Knowledge Centres is far different from the Consultancies one which comes to our campus for hiring. Generally these knowledge Centres mostly hires only from IIT Bombay, IIT Madras and few other Business schools and they mostly do not prefer hiring students from other colleges.But sometimes, when they need more interns they release their HJD’s in January I’m not sure that if one should rely on this opportunity by skipping the CDC internship,because these are not sure to hire you.For a general supply chain management role, as I told you that if you have a very good knowledge and interest in this field then you should keep pushing yourself towards this and have projects and publications and everything related to this field. Generally,in India the majority of this field is occupied by the students who have done their MBA and all. So people generally don’t prefer having engineering students in supply chain management roles.But,yes I believe there are certain opportunities if you work very hard and develop a specific interest in this field.This is something I would give as a suggestion because it is not a generalise field in which everyone can try, so you have to have a very specific interest.'),
(531, 4, 'core and non-core', 'Cool,I think you have provided a great insight for 1st yr. students,Thanks Rohan. And my next question is, How to prepare for core discipline and describe the choice between core and non-core?', ' On speaking about this particular field in which I’m working on, is the supply chain management which is specifically the core of industrial engineering- which is my course and my masters is also in the same field. So this field for me is core but for someone else it would me non-core.Even if it is core or non-core it really doesn’t matter as long as you have a particular interest in any of them.So, I would only say that go for the one in which your interested because at the end of the game it totally depends on one’s particular INTEREST.'),
(532, 4, 'Advice to 2nd years', 'Okay cool , and then the next question is , What advices would you like to give for 2nd years, who are currently thinking about which area to pursue like Coding,Consulting,Data Sciences…etc?', 'First of all ,if they have an interest in any of them then should try exploring it further.For my part,when I was in my 2nd yr. I took 2 projects and also done a course on finance. I was also involved in AGV and I was also working on autonomous robotics. I also did 2 projects on data sciences.I also did 1 month internship in core mechanical engineering.This is how I explored and choose what to do and what not to do. The same thing goes to you also explore a lot of things, then you yourself can know what path to choose based on your interest.'),
(533, 4, 'Effect of KGP life', 'So a last question, Is there any effect of KGP life on your achievement?', ' Obviously, there is a lot of effect of KGP life on my achievement.If I compare myself in 1st year and 2nd year there was a lot of change in me not just in my technical capabilities but also in my character and my urge or my ability to manage/handle the things. My major priority was being involved in SPATS and NSS. I have learnt about a lot of organisations ,time management skills. Apart from all of these, I was part of technical team of AZAD hall.Actually if you take part in any happenings which takes place in campus you will come to know about many things ,which may or may not come in use at present but they surely come in use in your future. As societies helps us to explore ourselves through different things,for example: I have to build UI for my project consideration in my internship, If I’ve thought back then in my 1st and 2nd years that everybody are doing machine learning and data sciences why am I doing web development where it is not useful though, by now I wouldn’t able to tell myself that I can do my work well.'),
(534, 12, 'Nature of the interview process', 'Hello everyone, today we have Ms Anusha Sharan, who has recently got selected in the Boston Consulting Group. Anusha, can you mention the general process of interviewing at the companies that you have interviewed for?', 'Hello everyone. So I interviewed for two companies, EY-Parthenon and the Boston Consulting Group. We received an email around the last week of July from both the companies, asking the students who were interested in applying for the Associate position to send their applications. Around one week later the shortlists of both the companies were received. BCG shortlisted around 33 students and while EY- Parthenon shortlisted 17 students. At EY- Parthenon, we had a buddy session and two rounds of case interviews before the final interview happened. The date of the final interview of EY- Parthenon clashed with that of the BCG final interview. I had to choose between one of the two firms and I decided to interview at BCG.'),
(535, 12, 'About interview rounds', 'Can you provide some deep insights into the interviews rounds you faced for Boston Consulting Group?', 'Once the students were shortlisted, there was an interactive session with Kharagpur Alumni currently working in BCG which was held in the campus itself. It was said to be non-evaluative and we just had a general discussion about things like — What is it like working in BCG? How is the working environment? What are the perks? After this session, there were buddy sessions that were organized for the shortlisted students wherein KGP alumni working at BCG practised cases with them and gave them feedback and tips to improve their case-solving abilities. Following the buddy session, we had two interview rounds between 12th and 14th August, and both were conducted by Senior Associates at BCG. Both the interviews started with me giving a short introduction of myself, after which I was asked to solve a case. Some students had more than two interviews. This batch of interviews was wrapped up within one week and 11 students were selected for the final interview which happened on 19th August in Kolkata. The final batch of interviews consisted of two rounds of interviews with people who held senior positions at BCG. After those two rounds, I progressed to the Partner round which was the final interview for the day. So the number of rounds for me was three but it varied between 3 to 5 for others.'),
(536, 12, 'Questions asked in different rounds', 'That’s a good insight into the general interview process. Moving on, can you mention the number and the type of questions that they asked in different rounds?', 'In my first interview, I was asked to estimate the number of roller coasters in India and my second interview was a timed case where I had to solve the case within a specified time frame. In my case, it was 15 minutes and it was broken down into 12 minutes for the actual case and 3 minutes for the synthesis and the provision of recommendations. It was a fairly simple Profitability case but the real challenge was to work through it quickly and not lose track of time. The first interview on the final day had a general discussion on my resume followed by two cases. The first case was a Market Entry case related to the energy sector which had a lot of data points. The second one was related to my resume and I was asked to describe how I would go about creating a perfect pianist. I had mentioned in my resume that I had been playing the piano for the past 12 years, so based on that and on the basis of the discussion that we had before the case interview he gave me a relevant case. So I suggest people be comprehensive with their CV and be prepared with possible related cases. The second interview on the final day had a Market Entry case where I was asked to figure out if shifting all operations to China would be feasible for a company based in America that sold different types of plastic goods. This was a relatively tricky case because the interviewer did not provide any data points. I therefore had to ask a lot of questions at every step of the interview to figure out how I would go about solving the case and arriving at the solution. Both the interviews lasted for 30 minutes and the end of every interview I was asked if I had any questions for the interviewer. The final round that had happened with the Partner lasted around 15–20 minutes. We discussed my resume for about 10 minutes and it was more of a free-flowing conversation rather than him asking me one question after another. After this discussion, he gave me a case where I was asked to provide insights and justifications for some business decisions that were related to the scenario that the Partner provided. He asked me questions like — Why am I making this business decision? How am I going to convince the client that my choice is correct even though he may not like to hear that his company is failing? At the end of this interview as well, I was given an opportunity to ask the Partner questions.'),
(537, 12, 'Change in Timeline', ' I hope students do prepare up for such questions. Moving on, was there any change in the timeline for 2019 as compared to that of 2018?', 'I would like to add that the timelines of 2019 are very different from 2018. The recruitment process in 2018 was very well spaced out. Hence, the final interviews basically wrapped up in October but then in 2019 the final interviews happened in August itself. I would suggest students be prepared for a scenario similar to 2019, but to expect the timelines to be unpredictable this year.'),
(538, 12, 'Preparation for technical rounds', 'After you had qualified for technical rounds, what changes you saw in your preparation?', 'There are no technical rounds as such in BCG, so I’m just going to explain the preparation for the case interviews. So ideally you should start preparing beforehand. You should not wait for the shortlists, if you think you have a chance of getting shortlisted. You could prepare guesstimates even if you think you don’t have a chance of getting shortlisted in a consulting firm because you never know, you might just get shortlisted because the criteria for selection differs among firms. Also, guesstimates are useful for multiple profiles and not only consulting. I started preparing with my case group a couple of days after I reached the campus and we solved a couple of cases per day with some gaps between the days. The cases were a mix of guesstimates and profitability cases; we increased the number of cases to a total of 4 once we got shortlisted. So one week into getting shortlisted, we had a fair idea of Profitability cases and once we had the sense of the basic framework we moved on to the Market Entry cases and unconventional cases.'),
(539, 12, 'Preparation tips', 'Anything you would like to mention that you think if you had done, it might have proved more beneficial for you?', 'Revision of cases. Due to the shortage of time I couldn’t properly revise all the cases I had practiced. I cannot stress enough on the importance of going through the cases you’ve solved, understanding where you had gone wrong, finding key takeaways from the case and trying out an alternative structure you could have used to solve the case. I would say the number of cases isn’t as important as solving your cases thoroughly and extracting the most from the cases you have already solved is.'),
(540, 12, 'Preparation Materials', 'What preparation material did you use for your preparation?', 'The resources that I had used were Case Interviews Cracked by IIT Bombay, Case Interview Secrets and LOMS by Victor Cheng, and Day 1.0 by IIT Madras.'),
(541, 12, 'Optimum time to start preparation', 'When do you think is the optimum time for the student to start preparing for the consulting firms?', 'I would suggest the students interested in consulting to start thinking about their consult prep from mid-June onwards. Do not underestimate the importance of a good resume, and build your resume from scratch. You should be ready with your resumes and (ideally) your cover letters too, by the second last week of July. I’m going by previous year’s timelines since I’m not sure how the coronavirus crisis is going to affect the schedules for this year, and the recruitment timelines are bound to be unpredictable. During mid-July, go through the set of 12 video lectures by Victor Cheng, which is available on YT. These are very short and will take you a couple of days to finish at the most. You will get a basic idea of what a case is, and what to expect in a case interview. You can also go through the Profitability and Market Entry frameworks in Day 1.0 and CIC, but don’t read any case except for the solved examples because then the cases will be wasted. You can do all of this on your own and you don’t need a case group for this. Start solving cases with your case group only when you’re done with all this and don’t blindly dive into solving cases without having any background knowledge. Form case groups by mid-July and start working on solving cases from the third week of July since you probably won’t get much time to prepare if the timelines are similar to last year. You could start with guesstimates since they don’t require the knowledge of frameworks and you could quickly solve them over a telephonic conversation, in case the campus reopens late.'),
(542, 12, 'General Funda', 'Coming to the final question, suppose a student from second year is looking forward to getting placement in the consulting firm, what suggestion might you give to him?', 'It would be best if you start thinking of consulting as a career option during your CDC internship and not before that. Instead of thinking about consulting this early, trying to follow what people who got selected did and ‘building your profile’ accordingly, you should explore all kinds of opportunities IIT Kharagpur provides you. You would get invaluable experience from this and once you find out where your interest lies, pursue it aggressively and you’ll see that it’s going to reflect on your resume automatically. Don’t worry about checking all the ‘right’ boxes so much, just do all the things you like while trying to balance your academics. Maintaining a CGPA of at least 8 is extremely important, despite consulting firms claiming to not have any CGPA criteria.'),

(544, 13, 'Nature of the interview process', 'Today we have Mr. Indresh Kryalos with us who has recently interviewed for the Boston consulting group. So Indresh, can you tell us about the general interview process of the company that you have interviewed for?', 'Hello everyone. Most consulting companies arrive off-campus so it’s not a much-standardised process. But it primarily involves three rounds, the first is shortlisting of CV. Second is a phone interview or a preliminary interview of sort listed candidates. It’s done over call or skype consisting of two to three interviews with different people. Final shortlisted candidates are interviewed over video call or are asked to flyover to Bombay office for a partner round, a partner is the senior member of the firm.');

(545, 13, 'CG Criteria ', ' Is there any CG criteria that these companies follow during CV shortlisting?', 'If you have a CG below 8 it becomes difficult to get shortlisted in the companies I interviewed. However, there are a lot of consultancy firms coming on campus like Auctus Advisors, A D associates and there consultant role is similar to product manager role up to some extent. For each of the company you can’t say that the CG matrix are the judges, however, there is definitely a function of POR and Projects.'),
(546, 13, 'FAQs', 'That’s a good insight for beginners. Moving on, can you mention the questions you felt were similar and students must prepare for them?', 'For the case interviews round, you are given a problem statement, you and the interviewer have to work through it together so you end up asking questions and gathering more relevant information out of interviewer and the interviewer job is to guide you to the final answer without being very simple about it. This is a major part of your preparation for the consultant job role. Apart from that you have HR round in which the questions will be from your CV so be well versed with your CV. General questions are, “Tell us something about yourself”, “Why consultancy and not something else”, “Why this company” along with some case question from your CV.'),
(547, 13, 'Case Groups', 'I hope students do look into the questions mentioned. You have mentioned about case groups. Why do you think a student preparing for Consultancy must form this case groups?', 'Case groups are quite important in initial part of your preparation, the thing with case preparation is that if you read a case you waste it because you haven’t put any thought behind it, you haven’t put any work in getting to the answer. You don’t have a reliable person who is also preparing, who will ask you the case who will guide you through the case but in the team of four people usually, one person read the case and does it with another person and now two people who know the case they do it with the remaining two so now it’s more optimised. In a case group of four people you end up wasting 25% cases. So four people is a good number for a case group.'),
(548, 13, 'Preparation for technical rounds', 'That’s a good insight for case group. Moving on, where there any puzzle or technical questions asked during the interview?', 'No, there are no technical questions for testing your problem-solving capability. However, let’s say if you have a prior internship in finance and your interviewer is also well versed in finance he may ask you questions that may be relevant to your internship or you should know for internship in finance. There are no technical questions as such for which you have to prepare. The case is more and the HR part is important.'),
(549, 13, 'Preparation for HR Round', 'Moving on, after qualifying for the case round, what were the changes in preparation changes you made for HR round?', 'The process essentially shifted from preparatory interview with your case group to mock interview with other people, you may not be as comfortable with like other case groups, recent graduates or even KGP alumni who are in senior position in those firms. It puts you in sort of stress environment and that is a big part of cracking the consultancy interview. Relax no matter who the interviewer is and you will be able to solve the case much better and be able to answer HR question as well.'),
(550, 13, 'How to start preparations?', 'What preparation should the students who are looking forward to getting placement in consulting firms start from now?', 'Now is not really the time to worry about case interviews or consultancy interviews in general. Right now the best things students can do is make a CV for this consultancy interview and apart from that I don’t think now is a good time to begin preparation. Being in lockdown the dynamics of internship are slightly changed, so you should still look to explore more about other sectors say finance, data analytics and coding whatever fancies you have. Two-three months are enough time for preparation in consulting firms. Once you usually return to the campus, you should start preparing. If you start preparing before I feel you may end up losing momentum or run out of cases. So this is not advised with my experience. If they want to do something, start making your CV.'),
(551, 13, 'Preparation Materials', 'I hope student do follow up with your advice. So, what resources did you followed during the preparation?', 'There is Day 1.0 by IIT madras campus and case interview crack book by IIT Bombay. These are two primary resources that most people are using. There are lot of case questions if you get out and search but lot of those case questions are for IIMs interview so people who are interviewing from IIM, it is more relevant to them. Apart from these, there are actually not very resources available. There are few PDFs out there with guesstimate questions that you will get. For case interviews sake these two are the only books I practice with.'),
(552, 13, ' Suggestion for second-year student', 'What suggestion you might give to a second-year student looking forward to placement in consulting firms?', 'The answer to this question for me is in two parts, so the first is as a second year you have a lot of opportunity on campus. To be fairly good at consulting interview, it requires just a window of two months or so. If you are a second-year you should not direct yourself to go to a consultancy firm. There are ample of opportunities for an IITian and you should explore those. And if you do not like any other field at the end of the day I think then you should look into consultancy because consultancy field in general offers you a lot of exposure to different fields so it is a gateway field essentially whereas a consultant I may be working on fishery or a social cause. If it doesn’t get narrow down over your 2nd, 3rd or 4th year then you should perceive that consultancy is a good option. Secondly, I did not do anything that was specifically oriented towards consulting. I just did what I enjoy. I explored my department for 2 years, did projects that are relevant to my department, internship and I was involved in dramatics as well as sports. So that worked out for me by giving me a holistic serious epiphany which has a lot of distinctive points. It’s a unique field. Now as I fifth year I have secured a job and when I look back into things I have done in my 2nd, 3rd, 4th year, I would not be able to do it with career orientation in mind. It did help me somewhere down the line. I would just say that explore what all opportunities IIT KGP have to give to you and do what you like.'),
(553, 13, 'Thank You Statement', 'Thank you for your time Indresh. I hope the KGP community has got to learn a lot from you.', 'Thank you'),
(554, 14, 'Nature of the interview process', 'Hello everyone, today we have Pallav Bhutani who has been placed at Boston Consulting group. So my first question is, what was general interview process for the companies you interviewed for?', 'Hello everyone, its great pleasure to be here. I had only interviewed for Boston Consulting Group during my placements. Most of the consulting firms including BCG generally follow a multi-tier selection process. Firstly, they might take an aptitude test followed by two-three or sometimes more than three case segments round. The interviewer provides you with a case at that time for which you have to consult to the client (Interviewer) the possible solutions . Finally. In HR round, the senior director generally asks your aspiration and judges you to be a good fit for company or not.'),
(555, 14, 'About HR Rounds', 'That’s a good insight for the beginners. Moving on to specifically to HR round, can you tell us the nature of it?', 'HR round is the last round before selection. So, its not as tricky as other technical rounds. There is a pdf by the name ’60 HR Questions’ over the internet. If one can go and hover over them, it won’t be that difficult to answer the questions in the final round. A basic suggestion is, be true to yourself, explain your needs and wants to the interviewer and explain how they match with that of the company.'),
(556, 14, 'Preparation for Technical Rounds', 'I hope our audience won’t be having any more doubts on HR round after this discussion. Moving on, what were the quizzes and technical question you faced during technical rounds and how do you think an aspirant can prepare for them?', 'For consulting, there are case rounds in which the interviewer (posing as a client) provides you with a real-life situation: for example, what should the company be doing during corona pandemic? Most of times they focus on some specific businesses, at any scale: Example: Carlos at KGP is facing decline in sales, what are the three things Carlos should do to overcome the situation? The problems asked are generic but the candidate is judged on how many insights he/she has brought up with limited information in a limited time of 20 mins.'),
(557, 14, 'Preparation Material', 'What courses or some books that you might suggest to other aspirants looking forward to placement in consulting companies?', 'Preparation for case interviews generally starts one month before the interview. You have to form case groups of 3–4 people. These are mostly practised and hence no books are there to tell you what to do. Case books of IIT Madras, IIT Bombay and case book by Victor Cheng had been followed by me for practice. 12 Videos of Victor Cheng are available on Youtube. They come in handy for starting the preparation.'),
(558, 14, 'Preparation for further rounds', 'I hope students do take a lot of suggestion from this. Moving on, after qualifying technical round, what changes do you see in your preparation?', 'Since there was not much time gap for me between both rounds, hence there were not many changes as such. However, during technical round, you are not supposed to tell of your aspiration, you are judged aptitude and mental ability. In HR round, you are judged on how you fit for the company. You can even learn the aspiration of the interviewer.'),
(559, 14, 'Suggestions for Second Year Students', 'Moving on. Suppose a second year is looking forward for getting placed in consulting firm, what suggestion you might give to him.', 'To be frank, we did not have more than 14 days of preparation for the consulting firms and these were enough. Even if I got one month more, I would be solving these cases the same way I did during the 14 days. Because it’s more about your thinking ability, not like coding that you need to know some algorithms for solving. If you see the Victor Chang videos, you will understand that the videos there are very generic, you will be able to go through the interview. If he/she knows the logic and knows what the interviewer is asking, he might get selected as well. So, it nowhere necessary to start from 1st or 2nd year. Just 2–3 weeks of preparation might do the work.'),
(560, 14, 'Views on impact of IIT KGP on his life', 'Thanks Pallav. My final question, what changes has KGP bought in your life?', 'KGP has bought a considerable change to my life and I say to everyone, the companies that this person is an IITian and will do the assigned task; however, they look whether the person is responsible or not. This is the portion where Kharagpur provides you with an edge. All the activities of Kharagpur, curricular or extracurricular, all the events build up the persona of the individual. Working in the fests or other organization activities provides you with know-how of how to deal with the person and this is what every company looks into while hiring. It might sound harsh but PORs are needed in the workflow.'),
(561, 14, 'Thank You Statement', 'It was a great talk with you. Thank you for your time Pallav.', 'Thank You.'),
(571, 2, 'General Interview Process', 'So my first question to you, Mayank, is what were the general interview process for the companies you interviewed. Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'Regarding my interview process for the companies I focused as a prime during my placement semester. So, consultancy was my target from my 4th year. For the same I interned at KPMG as a consultant and strategist and in that I got a good essence of what a consult firm does apart from the kind of projects that can be given to the people who work in consultancy firms. So, following the same, I made my whole plan for placement in the semester to focus majorly on the companies which look for case solving abilities in candidates. So, general interview process for those consults or the companies which look for solving cases and all is generally in 3–4 rounds, depends on the nature of the job and the nature of profile you are going to get. So in that one round is HR which is kind of, you know, in HR round they try to focus a lot in knowing the fact whether you are really interested in this profile or not and what change can you bring as an individual if you join the company. Apart from that suppose I also appeared for the APM profile of Flipkart. So in that there is a technical round as well. One round was product case round, one round was simple analytical round in which estimates & all are asked, and one was obviously HR round.'),
(572, 2, 'General Questions', 'So Mayank my next question is could you please list down questions which were asked to you in different rounds, whether it is a technical question or any other general question you think will be helpful for the students. Like some examples of a few of the questions you feel important.', 'Okay so again I would like to suggest all the students that if you start preparing for any company, or any profile, just don’t make your plan just to focus on the profile you are going for. Your plan should be company relevant, not process relevant. So, again I’ll give the example of the consulting firms which I interviewed in. In that, the rounds are mainly, you know if I take the example of Auctus Advisors, one round is purely guestimate & analytical reasoning in which they try to know whether you are good with numbers or not. And in the second round they try to know the, you know there is a decision making round in which they give different scenarios which can arise in different kinds of projects, such kind of life problem scenarios are asked and you have to take the right decision. So using the decision tree algorithms and other technical skills you need to figure out which decision would be the most beneficial. The third round was the case round. A case round in which marketing case or market entry profitability case were asked. So this was for consulting firms. For profiles like APM, they try to know your technical skills as well apart from the case solving abilities. In technical skills you need to understand how applications and websites work at the back-end. What are the features that nowadays technology is adapting a lot to, for example the GPS system, how does the GPS system work? What is the algorithm for pricing in Uber. These kind of questions were asked in APM. APart from that they asked puzzles. Puzzles are something that everyone should practice because not only in consultancy firms but also in many other profiles puzzles are asked to understand whether you have the ability to understand, or rather, do you have the analytical ability to solve the problems which can come to you during your time of job.'),
(573, 2, 'Resources to prepare', 'Thanks Mayank for these two questions and can you list down some of the resources which you find relevant for consulting firms? Like preparation material from which they should refer. Suppose I’m a beginner or completely noob in this field and I feel that I should go for it, so how should anyone prepare?', 'So for consulting firms the preparation is a 2–3 step process. First is you should understand this i.e. start getting the feel of consultancy firm. For that I will strongly suggest that do one intern in consultancy firm so that you understand what happens inside. However if you want to directly start with preparation, first of all what my plan was that I have always read a book as a bible for any profile I have learned. So for consultancy, Case Interview Cracked from IIT Bombay was my bible. However apart from that there are 3–4 more books like IIM Case Interviews, then there is one from, like this there are 3–4 more books. CIC was my main book which I tried to focus on. On that you will get to know that there are 4–5 categories of different case questions that can be asked. One being guesstimate, second is profitability, third is market entry, fourth is merger & acquisition, and fifth is decision making. All consultancy firm do not ask from every variety, Auctus also includes the decision tree type of questions which is where they try to focus. And, apart from this when you start reading from these books, you need to practice cases because it’s not about the knowledge that you have regarding the different kind of cases, it is about how you communicate this to the interviewer. For this you need to practice a lot and for practicing you should make case groups with people who are trying to appear for consultancy jobs. So I made a case group of 4 students, all final years who were very enthusiastic for consultancy jobs and used to practice for 3–4 hours a day for about 3–4 weeks. After those 3–4 weeks, all of us got a good essence of how an interviewer would drive a consultancy case and how to tackle that. Once you have that in mind then you need to practice as much cases as you can. So this is the standard process, first is get a book & start reading it, second is when you get an essence, make a case group and start practicing as much as you can until you are able to crack all the cases, and thirdly cover all the variety and all the kind of possible scenarios that an interviewer can ask.'),
(574, 2, 'Frequently asked HR questions', 'Thanks Mayank for this and we will now focus on the frequently asked questions which you face that students find most difficult. And specifically in the context of HR round, like some FAQs from consulting firms having HR rounds. Like I guess more or less each & every one has so some of the frequently asked questions in HR round.', 'So, I particularly remember the HR round of Auctus Advisors. That HR round was taken by the Managing Director of Auctus Advisors. He was sitting in the Philippines and I was in my room and it was taken on video conferencing. Now you can understand the scenario, you are sitting in front of him, you are doing a video conference. You don’t have the time to think a lot. You need to respond quickly. So they take advantage of this fact that you have 2–3 seconds to think & whatever first thing you will speak, they will consider it as an honest reply. Hence you should not change your answers. So in HR round they basically try to put you in a diplomatic situation in which you need to take a side. For example, what if your boss says something and you know he’s wrong. So in that part whether you will counter your boss or do whatever he is saying, so what will you do in that case. So in that case I’m not saying that there is a standard reply to this. You can reply whatever you think is right keeping in mind that way in which you work in your surroundings. But just make sure that whatever side you are taking should lead to finally benefit of the company, not an individual. So for HR round I would like to say that just be honest, be clear with each & every word written in your CV because they try to point out the work ‘Statistics’ & what you have done. One more thing I would like to focus that is that students in their CV try to throw a lot of unnatural statistics and work that they have not done, that the company had been doing, for example if you go for in intern in a consultancy firm there are several projects. So in that projects what students do is that they list down all the problems. It’s not possible for you to take part in each & every project and each & every question in just 2 months. Again I’m not saying don’t write that, if you are writing that in your CV then be clear about what you have done and what was the responsibility of the company for completing that project.'),
(575, 2, 'Preparation advice', 'Okay cool. So what are the things that a student sitting for placement next year, more or less they will start preparing from July onwards after their final year intern, can do now from December to maximise their chance for getting through a company in this sector. So their placement preparation part more or less like when they return in campus what shall they prepare?', 'In general I would like to answer this in 2 parts. In general if you are preparing for placements so basically getting yourself placed is a 2 step process — one is clearing the test & being in the top percentile in which the company shortlists you, second is making it through the interviews. So in test most of the companies ask puzzles & all the content of categories — English, Logical Reasoning & Quantitative Aptitude. These three things are a must that you should start doing from now, and apart from that you should have a bit of technical inclination as well. For that I would suggest start coding as well. The best resources for that is www.geeksforgeeks.com . So open that site, make your account and solve each & every question. So if you start doing from now a question a day, by the time you will land in your placement semester, you will have a very good idea of what companies ask in their technical rounds. If I focus only on consultancy firms to prepare for this then I’ll say start early. Have buffer time with you so that you can revise all the concepts and go through as many cases as you can. Basically from now you can start reading a book and discussing the kind of cases & projects that are currently going on in different companies so that you can get an idea that in which direction a company is heading. I’m sure that if you start exploring the different types of projects that companies are nowadays taking, so you will get to know that a lot of consultancy firms are including the aspect of technology also. So if you have an idea of how the technology works nowadays, you can not just crack the cases but also suggest some very unique ideas to the company so that they can move ahead in future. For example, one question that was asked to me in APM interview was What if Flipkart launches a version of Amazon Echo as a product in India. So whether it is a good idea or not. So you should understand that what an Amazon Echo does, what is it’s price & what price should it be launched by Flipkart, all the aspects. So this covering all the aspects takes time and a person can expertise on this by only reading different stuffs, blogs, that are available nowadays that cover different scenarios and interact as much as you can with your seniors, with your batchmates to work your way.'),
(576, 2, 'Most effective preparation strategy', 'Okay cool. So which part of your placement preparation did you find most effective & rewarding and if so , why?', 'So the part most effective for me was self study. It’s fine if you study in a group, try to understand the different fundas & taking the help of your friends. It’s fine but I will say that it is very necessary for you to sit alone with a book, with a laptop and understand your weakness & strengths because it is you who will finally sit in the interviews and alone. There will be no one to guide you. Apart from this also what I have seen that has happened with a lot of students is that they have a lot of knowledge in their head, they know a lot of coding very well, they have a good knowledge of financial firms as well and for whatever profiles they are preparing for. But they don’t communicate it correctly with the interviewer, so you should understand that placement is a relative process. If you are bad but the best among all, then you will get selected. But if you are good & worst among all, you will get selected. So you need to make yourself better than others, relatively, for getting yourself placed. So I will say that sit alone, start analyzing yourself, that was the most effective part of my placement process.'),
(577, 2, 'Preparation after shortlist', 'So was there any technical round once you were shortlisted, if so then how did you prepare for it?', 'For consultancy firm there is no technical round. For profiles like product manager, there is a technical round. Technical round doesn’t mean that you should know coding, first of all. For whatevery company you are going to prepare for, understand that what is the expectation of the company from the candidate. If you are preparing for Product Manager, the questions will be like what is the storage space of G-mail, if we look worldwide. So you will start at an individual level about what is the basic space G-mail usually takes on a laptop then looking at the fact that how many G-mail users are there. So it is a technical round but they try to understand your inclination clubbed with you analytical solving skills.'),
(578, 2, 'Core discipline', 'So did you have a checklist for preparing for your core discipline? If yes, then please elaborate.', 'I didn’t focus a lot on my core to prepare, honestly. However if you are really interested in your core I would say to study well for the GATE exam that takes place at the end of your semester & try to score as much as possible & you will have the knowledge whatever the core disciplines demand from you. However I would suggest that focus on the company that you are trying to target and do the homework of trying to find all the expectations that are there from you.'),
(579, 2, 'Any advice', 'So more or less I think you have provided a great insight for preparing for consulting in campus. So anything else you would want to share with the students?', 'So I would like to share that yes maybe your final aim is different, you are trying to go for higher studies or preparing for UPSC or different examinations but keep this one thing in mind that this one stage will come in your life — you will be in your final year and all your friends will be sitting for placements. So if you’re not going to sit in placements then make your mind a bit early and start focusing on the bigger picture in your mind that if you are going for UPSC then make your mind in the 3rd year only however if you are unsure about the fact that whether you will sit in placements or not I’ll suggest that make your mind 100% for the fact that you are going to sit for placements and trying to get a job. For the same start as early as possible because a lot of things go around like you have CAT, you have semester B.Tech projects, M.Tech projects. Apart from that you have to go for classes, appear for tests, prepare for interviews and finally there is a lot of physical exhaustion as well. So it will help you a lot even if you start in your 3rd year like the preparation of all these things, it will help you a lot.'),
(580, 2, 'Role of KGP life', 'So a last question, how did your KGP life & your 4–5 year stay at IIT Kharagpur help you in fetching your dream job or more or less your dream profile?', 'So when I entered into IIT Kharagpur I was completely unaware of what I wanted to do. I was unsure of whether I wanted to go for my core field or not. It took me 2 years, once I entered my 2nd year I realised that my core Mining is not the one which I would like to pursue in the long run. So from there I started exploring the different avenues that IIT KGP provides. So yes the best thing in IIT Kharagpur is that everything is self-driving. You need not to really brainstorm a lot on what you need to do and what you don’t because you get a lot of vacations in summers and December in which you can intern in different profiles and find out which fields you are interested or not. So KGP life for me helped a lot like in terms of confidence, communication & logical reasoning. All these 3 aspects were greatly boosted because of all what I had done in KGP life & I would urge all the students as well to utilize your time here well, do good things, valuable things, and every little thing is going to help you.'),

(582, 6, 'Companies Interviewed For', 'What were the companies that you were interviewed for?', 'I did not sit for the conventional placement season in December, rather I sat for all the Consult companies that have their procedures in the month of August. The process starts from July end and goes on until the first week of August. Three companies come to campus for Consult in July-Aug, Parthenon EY, McKinsey and BCG (Boston Consulting Group). L.E.K Consult also looks to come, but nowadays, it takes people for interns and provides them with PPOs, rather than coming for placements; it did not come for the placement season this year. However, in the month of Oct-Nov, you have Dalberg, which is a social consultancy firm coming to the campus.'),
(583, 6, 'Interview Process', 'What was the interview process of these companies? What was the nature of the interview process and the different interview rounds?', 'I was placed in Parthenon EY, and the interview process of Parthenon was as follows- Initially, they do a CV shortlisting, where they have their portal, and we need to submit our CV there. On the basis of that, they shortlist around 20–23 people. They basically look for academic excellence in your CV, a good internship, a good PoR and extracurricular activities as well ( They can be in the form of different competitions, or you are very active on social ventures or involved with an NGO etc.). Also, something like research papers or conferences becomes a plus point. After the CV ShortListing round, we were assigned buddies, who carried out an improvement session and helped us in understanding how the further rounds would be. So after the buddy session, you have interview rounds, which are telephonic or skype interviews, after which 7–8 people out of the 20–23 people will be shortlisted, who are called to the company’s office and then there are interviews taken by the Senior Consultant, VPs (Vice-President) and Partners of the company. As in my case, there were four interview rounds, the first and the second ones were with a Senior Consultant, the third was with a VP and the fourth one was with a Partner. Following which, I got my placement offer.'),
(584, 6, 'Questions asked', 'Could you please list down the questions that you were asked in different rounds?', 'For the first three interview rounds, they made me do a case, and after we were done with the case, they discussed my CV. Also, if a person has some expertise in a field that you’ve worked in too, he might ask questions about it as well, but then mostly there are general questions. However for the partner round, it was more of an interaction, they asked me questions about my CV, and also questions like Why I wanted to join the company? And what were my long-term goals? Where do I see myself in five years? are some common questions. Questions like What were your major databases? What was the scalability of the project? Can it be implemented on a larger scale or not? were some of the questions that were asked me, based on the projects that I’d done and they might vary from person to person, hence it is important for you to be prepared to answer them. Apart from questions from the CV, they also ask some basic questions like Why this company? Or why this particular profile? Why this role? Why do you want to get into consulting at all? What do you know about Consulting? so that is something you should be prepared with. Basically, they just want to know how good you are a fit in that particular company.'),
(585, 6, 'HR and technical rounds', ' How were the HR and the technical rounds?', 'There were no separate HR or Technical rounds. But however, if you have worked on some project involving AI/ML or anything technical, the interviewer can also ask those kinds of questions, so you need to be ready to face such questions. However, you can also have Math intensive cases sometimes.'),
(586, 6, 'Advice for upcoming placement season', 'What is your advice to the students sitting for placements this year?', 'Very limited number of firms come for Consult placements to KGP. Out of the 1300 people, only 2–3 people are hired per company, so there is very intense competition. And because the first round is CV shortlisting, so, people who are highly inclined towards taking up such a profile should focus on making their CV/ Résumé really well. Generally, the CDC template we have and the Consulting Profile CV are a little different. And therefore, you need to make two different CVs for this. It is important for them to talk to a lot of seniors, and contact them, to get their CV verified and checked. Additionally, they can also contact seniors to ask them for their preparation. They should be able to present whatever they have done till now in an excellent way so that they get shortlisted. Also, they should do some preliminary research on the company because when they go for the further rounds of the interview, that will help them. Forming a good case group, and practising a lot of cases, and building good business acumen and focussing on your soft skills is really important. The way you solve a case, the way you keep other people informed, and how you go about solving the entire case-solving process is really important. Since Consulting is a client-based profile, you will have to be good at all of these.'),
(587, 6, 'Resources and material', 'Is there any preparation material for practising a good number of cases?', 'The general material that most people follow is to watch Victor Cheng’s videos for case framework on YouTube and I would suggest they also watch Victor Cheng’s LOMS (look over my shoulder) which are basically recorded cases, where he is interviewing a candidate and he also gives some insights. CIC Case Interview Crack which is a Case Prep book of IIT Bombay and Day 1.0 which is the Case Prep book of IIT Madras are the two most essential and basic books required for preparation of cases. Apart from these, there are case books of IIM A and IIT K, which can also be used for preparation of cases. And you are also required to practice guesstimates. The best way to practice guesstimates is to catch hold of your friends and just engage them in a conversation that involves preparing guesstimates. In working out guesstimates, your approach is the one that is more important than the final answer.'),
(588, 6, 'Any final advice', 'Anything else that you would like to share with the students?', 'Be confident about whatever you’ve done till now, and try to present that in a good way, these two things are really important. Also, practice a good number of cases, be thorough with the framework and develop your business acumen. One thing that people should avoid is to mug-up the cases or the framework, rather they should try to have their own way of solving a case. That is very important, and that comes only with practice, the more number of cases you solve, the better you get at it.'),
(589, 15, 'Nature of the interview process', 'What was the general interview process for the company you interviewed for? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'The process is pretty similar for most consultancy firms, it starts with an initial CV shortlist, which is done on the basis of your CGPA (should be 8+ ideally), internships, projects, PORs on campus, extra-curricular activities, or basically anything that helps you stand out. After shortlists are out you generally start with a couple of telephonic rounds, and if shortlisted, you have final interviews with the partners or directors of the firm. That is the case for Auctus Advisors as well, there were two telephonic interviews with the allotted buddy, followed by an online VC interview with a manager and then a director, all in the month of November, mostly all of them being eliminating rounds. If you make the final shortlist, you have 1 or 2 final interviews on December 1st, Day 1 of CDC placements.'),

Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'Consultancy firms usually focus only on case interviews. In a case interview, you are given a problem statement, for example, ‘A restaurant is facing declining profits — figure out why and give suggestions’, and you are supposed to work with the interviewer to reach the solution. I was asked to estimate the number of crows in Bangalore in my first buddy round, another interviewer asked me to make a growth strategy plan for a chemical-producing company, my final interview with the director was helping an airline company decide if they should start a direct flight from Kolkata to Goa. The cases are supposed to be interactive in nature, they generally judge you on your solution structure, clarity of thought, quality of suggestions and problem-solving skills. There are different categories of cases as well — guesstimates, profitability, market entry and pricing are the most common.'),
(591, 15, 'FAQs', 'What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'For HR, standard questions like — ‘Tell us about yourself’, ‘Why consulting’, ‘why this particular firm’, ‘best intern and why’, ‘CV walk-through’, and any questions from what you have written in your CV are common.'),
(592, 15, 'Suggestions for students sitting for placements', 'What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector?', 'They can start with making their CVs and writing their cover letters for the application processes. Make sure you get your CVs reviewed by many seniors and alums, that really helps. They can also start making case groups with reliable people, which are essential when preparing for case interviews. A case group should ideally have 3–4 people. The timeline for this year’s process is very unclear as of now, so students can also start with their case prep after they are done with their CVs. For case prep, IIT Bombay’s CIC and IIT Madras’ Day 1.0 is the popular books, so practice those cases with your case group. Once they have the basics right, they can start contacting alums and buddies for practice cases as the number of cases in the books is limited. Also, practice cases with other case groups, so you get more comfortable with interviewing with different people, that also gives you access to more number of cases.'),
(593, 15, 'Preparation for technical rounds', 'How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted?', 'There isn’t really any technical round in the recruitment processes of consultancy firms. Just focus on your case prep, and be very thorough with your CV. You should be familiar with the technical aspects of your internships or projects that you have mentioned in your CV. Some cases can be very math-intensive, and speedy and accurate calculations are important, so ensure you are comfortable with that.'),
(594, 15, 'General Funda', 'Anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'So case prep isn’t an individual task, ensure you have a good case group of 3–4 people, also practice a lot of cases with alums and other case groups. Don’t wait for shortlists to start preparing, even if you don’t make the shortlists, there are a lot of firms that come during CDC placements which take case interviews or guesstimates. While doing cases, don’t memorize frameworks or stick to a rigid structure, you should be able to come up with a new structure or improvise as the case progresses, as per the requirement. With case prep, also try to squeeze in some little prep time for other profiles, like coding, quant, finance, etc., and be sure of what profiles you want to sit for in placements. For junior students, maintain a decent CG of preferably 8+, that is very important. All the best!'),

Communiqué IIT Kharagpur, interacted with him on the interview process and the strategy he adopted for its preparation. Here, we present you a glimpse of the brief interaction we had with him. We thank Mr. Rajgaria for spending his valuable time with us for the same.So, Subham, What was the general interview process for companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'Sure. Mckinsey has this portal which was released just around August where you will have to send your cover letter and your resume. So based on these, they shortlist around 15 students after which they conduct a buddy session. What happens in the buddy session is that 2 people from the company who might be your alum, might be alums of other colleges, like 3–4 yrs senior to you, help you in the process of preparing for the interview, which will be coming up later. What happens in these types of interviews for consultancy companies is that you have case interviews, where you are given a scenario, which might be about the problems with the company, lets say the revenues are falling, or someone has launched a new product, and you have to identify the problem and give recommendations. The buddies help you prepare for such cases and gives you some tips about how to go about this process. After this, there was a round with some of the people at Mckinsey. That was round 1. That was around 11th of September.In between we had 15–20 days with the buddies. This time it was a little short. Last year, my seniors had a longer period, the interview was in October.'),
(603, 1, 'Buddy session', 'Was the buddy session evaluated?', 'The company will tell you that it is non-evaluative, however I am not sure. There might be a 50–50 chance that the buddy might put that he has done well in the buddy session, so it is important to take care during these buddy sessions and actually do them well. So, on 11th of September, we had round 1, I had 2 rounds of interview on that day with a few other people at Mckinsey. Some of my seniors and batch mates had 3 rounds, depending on how well their interviews were. Finally, they shortlisted 5 people for the partner round, where partners from Mckinsey take your interview. So that happened on 13th On that day, again, I had 2 rounds of interviews, both were partner rounds. So, this was the general interview process, with the final round on 14th of Sept. This was the entire process.'),
(604, 1, 'General questions', 'Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'Sure, as I mentioned earlier, these are generally case interviews. Case interviews is identifying problems.Apart from case interviews, what they ask is our guesstimates. For eg, you will have to guess how many planes are flying in India or a question which I was asked in the first round was, what was the market size of the e-commerce business in India. So, what is important here is that depending on the interviewer, he may not be looking for the exact number, but the process behind it- approach. So, it has to be logical, structured, it is not something that you just come up with a number in your mind. Even if the number is correct, that does not say that you are a good candidate. But if your logic is correct and you might hit the number by a factor of 10, it usually works out and is worth more. In the 2nd Interview of the 1st round, there was a sort of an HR question, like we already had a device planned for a bank, we have to make sure that the banks employees follow it. So, I was asked that this scheme, which was proposed by Mckinsey is followed by the client. So, these were some of the questions and normal case interview questions can be easily found in the case interview books, such as CIC by IIT Bombay, IIT Madras Day 1.0. This are the books which the candidates can refer to and have more idea about how case interviews are. They did not ask any puzzle as such, but they do ask a lot of HR questions, like, why do you want to join consulting, or tell me something about yourself which is not on your CV. Its not very typical, they don’t ask your strengths and weaknesses, they might, but rather they will ask you, something that you really work hard for that you cherish it now that you did that through your hard work, or where you show leadership. Candidates should prepare for these types of questions because these can be asked at every interview.'),
(605, 1, 'Resources for HR', ' Is there any resource where candidates can prepare for HR?', 'I don’t think there is something for HR. HR rounds are mostly done by CV itself. I think you should be thorough with your CV, you should be clear why you took a decision at a particular point of time. If you have done do a FT, it should not be only because of the academic part, you should not only talk about academic part, but how it helped to develop your personality. What I think is, candidates should try to bring a holistic experience in what they tried out during their stay at IIT Kharagpur. Do not only look at one aspect. There is no specific resource which I can point out, but being thorough with your CV and yourself is the most important part.'),
(606, 1, 'FAQs in HR', 'What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'You should sort out where you have shown leadership, what did you do to demonstrate that you are out of the crowd. Everyone is unique.

It is very difficult to manage both which I realized from my personal experience. So, I would suggest that the candidates should clear it out which kind of job they want and which sort of companies they want to target because it is almost impossible to target all kinds of companies. It is very difficult because there are a platform of opportunities in IIT Kgp. Once they start preparing for different kinds of job profiles, they will understand what job they want and this should be very clear to them at the beginning itself. To maximize the chances of placement, once you choose, be thorough with that, follow the specific routines. Everyone knows the basic types of questions in each type of profile, so prepare accordingly. Practice well, give your best.'),
(608, 1, 'Consultancy', 'When did you think of going into consultancy?', 'I guess I thought of joining consultancy once I started. I had applied for BCG. Then I talked with some of my alums and thought that it is a very exciting job.I thought of giving it a shot, so I started preparing around last part of July and 1st week of August, and I really enjoyed doing those case interviews. That is what tempted me to actually prepare for it. I was simultaneously working for my software job as well. It was difficult for me, so I suggest the future candidates to try to figure this out early, but it’s OK if you can’t figure it out even till placement time, if you can manage both, I’s great, you can have many opportunities and finally decide. If you can’t, I would say, it is better to decide as early as possible.'),
(609, 1, 'Helpful Strategies', 'What were the strategies which helped a lot in the process of preparation?', 'The most important part was solving puzzles and doing those case interviews. When you solve a case interview, you find out a problem, or if you solve a puzzle, may be related to probability or common sense, it keeps you thinking and helps you grow. These kinds of puzzles improve your thinking and there are many approaches to each and every problem. These puzzles motivate you to learn more. Initially, you may not be able to solve the puzzles, but once you start getting it, it makes you feel good and try on more. It makes you feel positive. After coming to IIT after JEE, many people lose the spirit and zeal to solve problems like in the JEE days. But if you keep practicing, this will motivate you to learn more.');

Buddy sessions help you know what kind of cases that company may ask. They try to help you to come into the firm. A buddy generally gives you the cases which have arisen before or are generally asked in companies. Also, forming a case group and solving it with different people helps you to get different lines of thought from different people.

In the initial stages, you can listen to both sides, act as an interviewer and interview someone else. That part is also important because you have to guide the interviewee to the answer.

Some basic questions of probability were ls very important, almost all the companies ask these types of questions. If not a consultancy company, I was looking for companies like Google, Microsoft.

Generally the selection process for consulting firms starts early from August or September. The first step in the process is CV shortlisting followed by case interviews which can vary from Buddy calls, Manager/Director level calls to the final Partner rounds. In BCG, 30 students were shortlisted for the case interview process followed by 2 to 3 Buddy rounds which are said to be non evaluative. 10 students out of the entire pool were called for the final interview rounds in Kolkata where another 3–4 rounds were conducted with the Managers and the Partner before the final offers were rolled out. Similar was the case for the EY Parthenon, the initial shortlist was of 17 students followed by an on-campus Buddy round and 2 interviews with the Managers on VC. They finally called 7–8 students for the final interviews in Mumbai where another 3 rounds were conducted with the Managers and the Partner. For Auctus Advisors, the process starts a little late, the CV submission is done from the CDC platform only and the shortlist is released by October. The process is again similar, starting with a buddy round followed by a Manager and a Director round on VC. 10 students were shortlisted for the final round on Day 1 of the placements and another 3–4 rounds were conducted with the Directors before shortlisting the final candidates for the job role.'),

As any other interview, it starts with you introducing yourself to the interviewer followed by a couple of cases that need to be structurally solved and concluded with the help of the interviewer at each step followed by some HR questions depending on the interviewer. There are no separate HR rounds in the process as the nature of the interviews are such that communication skills and fit for the role becomes an eccentric part of the process itself.'),

It is very important to keep this in mind that the initial introduction sets the tone of the interview, so a crisp and preferably structured answer prepared for the same helps in going a long way along with the case interview process. Other questions could be along the lines of Why Consulting? Why Firm? and other basic HR questions that can be prepared as well.'),
(623, 16, 'Must prepare before Interview', 'What students must definitely prepare for before facing the interviewer?', 'The students who are willing to apply for consulting job roles need to start preparing early from the summers itself. They can start with forming a case group with 3–4 like minded students aiming for the similar profiles. Next step would be to draft their own CVs/Cover Letters from scratch. A lot of thought process goes into reflecting yourself on a piece of paper, so it is very crucial to get your CV rectified by seniors and understand what is relevant and what is not. Though the timelines will be very unpredictable this time, the students can still make use of this time to get through some of the basic theories/frameworks and guesstimates given in the resources like Victor Cheng videos, Day 1.0 and Case Interview Cracked and start practicing cases with their groups as soon as they reach campus.'),
(624, 16, 'How to start preparations?', 'Any advice to the students who would be sitting for placement this year from now till December so that they can maximize their chance of getting placed in a consultancy firm?', 'With respect to consulting, there are very few companies that visit the campus for placements and have limited openings. At the same time it is important to realize that the process for case preparation is not limited to select few companies like these but relevant to many other companies/roles that require a similar skill set. Being said that, in terms of suggestions in preparation as per my experiences, it is equally important to periodically reflect back on previous cases and evolve your approach step by step. Recording your own cases and reviewing them back is a handy approach to improve case flows. For me personally, solving unconventional cases helped me a lot in improving my structure and could work out for you as well, if structuring is at all a problem. It is equally important to understand the role of a good interviewer while practicing cases within the group and make sure the feedback is as detailed as possible after each case. Though the process demands a lot of time, efforts and commitment, I can surely say that the experience is rewarding beyond results and the offer is just a cherry on the cake.'),
(625, 16, 'Preparation for Technical Round', 'How did you prepare for technical rounds like coding rounds or something in a similar manner?', 'Well there are no such coding rounds if you are applying for a consulting role as we discussed earlier, there are only case interviews and the case preparation for the same can be done through various resources like Day 1.0 from IIT Madras, Case Interview Cracked from IIT Bombay and Case Interview Secrets and LMOS by Victor Cheng. The starting point can be the Victor Cheng videos followed by the basic theory/frameworks given in Day 1.0 and CIC. There are a couple of solved cases also which the students can go through to understand how the flow for a case interview works. Rest of the cases need to be practiced with the group starting with Profitability cases followed by Market Entry and Unconventional cases. Within these sections also students can start with 1 star then 2 star cases and so on to develop a strong hold on the case solving mechanism. Doing guesstimates is another crucial thing which helps in broadening your thinking process. There could be many ways to solve a guesstimate, so students should try and brainstorm multiple methodologies to solve the same guesstimate and discuss it within their groups. Solving just a lot of cases should not be the priority, understanding the fundamentals and strengthening the first principles step by step are much more important.'),
(626, 16, 'About Coding or Finance knowledge ', 'So, any higher knowledge of coding or finance is not required?', 'No, nothing of that sort is required. All your previous experiences, be it in any field needs to be properly reflected on your CV which is the first step of the shortlisting process. Just in case the interviewer decides to grill you on your CV, you should be in a position to justify your work. After getting shortlisted, the majority of the focus is on your case solving skills in the interviews, rest everything becomes secondary.'),
(627, 16, 'About KGP life', 'What were your participations and involvements during your stay at Kgp?', 'Throughout my stay in the campus one of my singular focuses was to proactively try out various things which excites me to be a part of it. Moving ahead in this direction, I got various opportunities to explore in robotics, research, core and finance to find out the best fit for myself. The internships I did added more perspective to the kind of work culture that best suits me, the organizations I worked for nurtured my leadership and team working skills, the projects and the competitions helped me realize the importance of implementing my knowledge to something tangible. All these experiences contributed in some way or the other to help me figure out the right choice and consulting looked like a natural fit to go ahead.'),
(628, 16, 'General Funda', 'Any advice that you want to impart on students?', 'My advice to all the final year students sitting for placements would be to first of all ask themselves what are the profiles they are really interested in. Once they have decided that this is the kind of profile that they want to go for, they should start reaching out to seniors who are working in these firms to understand whether it is a right fit for themselves or not and then start enquiring about the selection processes and the kind of preparation that is needed for the same. Placements is a long process and it provides a lot of options/opportunities for the students to apply from. So it is very important to be aware as well as informed about the prospective role you want to end up with, as it comes with a commitment for at least a year or so.'),

Consulting, EY Parthenon. Auctus Advisors and Dalberg come in the later half of the semester. Final rounds for Auctus happen on Day 1. L.E.K. Consulting might not come because they might be shifting to an internship — PPO based model. There are some firms like EY, Deloitte, KPMG that come during the placements, which can be classified as tier 2 firms.'),
(631, 17, 'Personal view about Consulting', 'Why did you choose consulting as a career option? What do you think are the pros and cons of consulting, and who should look at a career in consulting?', 'I was a part of B Club in my first year, that is where I first heard about consulting. I realized the actual value addition of consulting when I was interning at Uber. My manager was an IIM-A graduate, and he had worked at a consulting firm for three years. The thought process and the structured problem solving approach that he had was fascinating. I had never been impressed so much with anyone in my life. He told me that consulting is something that gave him these skills and taught him how to break down problems and look at the solutions, and I was drawn towards consulting as a career option. I got an internship at LEK Consulting, and that experience helped me understand what consulting really is. I loved the experience at L.E.K. and I knew this is what I want to do. Pros: The learning is unparalleled as compared to any other industry. You will be working on multiple projects across different industries, and there’s an exponential learning curve. Everyday during my internship, I was working on different problems. This isn’t something any other industry would offer you. Consulting allows you to exit anywhere you’d like. What people usually do is that they stay in consulting for 2–3 years, and then transition into VC, Private Equity, Corporate Strategy or even start their own companies. Cons: There will be a lot of pressure; you will be working at least 12 to 14 hours a day, and if you’re looking for a 9–5 job, consulting is not for you.'),
(632, 17, 'Building a profile', 'As the consulting shortlisting process is extremely competitive, as a 1–2rd year, how do you build your profile for consulting?', 'So for the tier 1 firms around 500–600 people apply, and nearly 30 people are shortlisted for the interview round just based on CV. So the main step is building your CV. There are four aspects of your CV: CGPA: It is very important to keep it above 8 to be considered for at least the top consulting firm. Some people have shortlisted at 7.8 or 7.9. But 8+ CG is a must. Internships: In the final placement process, I have realized that most of the people who were shortlisted were people who had Day 1 internships. That is something they look for. BCG particularly paid a lot of attention to day 1 internships. They look for good brands, but the impact you’ve been able to bring at any firm is important. Particularly for first- and second-year students, it’s very important to explore things. For me, I interned at a start-up in my first year, which helped me a lot. It is not important to run after brands at least in the first and second year. So, build your internship part accordingly and try to land a Day 1 intern through CDC. Position of responsibility: Mostly all the Placecoms, GymK Gsecs, VP, Kshitij, SF with decent CGs were shortlisted. It’s important to differentiate yourself among the competitive pool, and showing that you’ve taken up these leadership positions is a great way. But don’t worry if you aren’t a part of any of these. I did not have any of the flashy PoRs, I wasn’t even a governor of any society until my 5th year. Extra Curriculars: For me, the extra-curricular helped me in differentiating myself. I have been a part of Inter IIT cultural meet, tech meet, and an inter IIT sports probable. I was working on a start-up, ‘InfinityBox’. So that start-up experience is also something that consulting firms really value and helps you differentiate yourself. Pick two or three things, and do amazingly well in those aspects.'),
(633, 17, 'For pre final Years', 'As a pre-final year student, what can students do to maximize their chances?', 'As a pre-final student, most of your profile has been built. There is not a lot that you can do in terms of your Resume. There are some things you can focus on: Try and land that Day 1 intern: Talk to students who’ve interned there, start preparing 1–2 months in advance. Start working on your communication skills: All the people that I know who got it into consulting have very good communication skills. I was the part of DebSoc that really helped me, and communiqué is doing great work to help people to build those communication skills. Get your resume reviewed: Get your resume reviewed by seniors who are at consulting firms or who have just got in. Don’t make your resume very technical, remember the person who’s reading your resume will most likely not understand your industry. Focus on the impact you’ve driven, and the results, and make sure the resume is written in layman terms.'),
(634, 17, 'Preparation for interview Round', 'If someone has been shortlisted for the interview, how should they go about the interview process?', 'Start prepping at least 1–2 months in advance. Start with the case group. The case group are three or four people who have been shortlisted or who might be shortlisted whom you can case-prep with. Some very useful resources were Victor Cheng Videos on youtube, IITB Case Interviews Cracked, IITM Day1.0, and IIMA case book. Once you’ve started preparing with your case group members, reach out to seniors who have got in the consulting firms, ask them to do mock interviews with them. McKinsey pays a lot of attention to HR questions as well. I was asked a few questions such as “Tell us about the time when you have faced a conflict”, , “What are you most proud of?” , “What have you done for your department?” ‘ “You have a lot of extracurricular achievement, how has that shaped you in life?” So if you have been shortlisted for McKinsey, it’s very important to focus on these questions and build stories around your life so you can effectively answer these questions. My McKinsey buddy told me that nearly 40% of the decision will depend on this.'),
(635, 17, 'Rewarding part of Interview', 'Which part of your placement preparation did you find most effective & rewarding, and if so, why?', 'Case prep with my case group members and my seniors was particularly helpful. I interned at L.E.K., and a few seniors at L.E.K. really helped me in strengthening my communication skills and helped me structure my thought process. I was also shortlisted for Parthenon before McKinsey, and through the interview process with Parthenon I was able to gain the confidence that I needed for my McKinsey rounds.'),

There’s a lot of overlap between debating and case interviews, and the communication skills I built through DebSoc was helpful. A few of my DebSoc seniors were at consulting firms. So I could easily reach out to them and ask them about their interview experience as well. My intern experience at L.E.K. consulting was a short 2 month stay in the world of consulting, and the problem solving approach I built at L.E.K. came in handy for my McKinsey interviews.'),
(637, 17, 'General Funda', 'Anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'Students in their first-second year are running after consulting, Data analytics, and big brands. In the first 1–2 years, no big brand will give you any responsibility as an intern, because you don’t have any experience and they can’t take risks. The biggest piece of advice from my end would be to work at start-ups. Pick up a problem you really care about, and see which startups as solving it. Reach out to them, and stop running after brands. Consulting is a great way to start your career and if you are really keen, and you don’t get in through your undergrad, you can look at an MBA. Most of these consulting firms such as Mckinsey, BCG, Bain, L.E.K hire extensively from the top IIMs. So, if you are sure that you want to go-to consulting and you could not get in through your undergrad, then an MBA is the best way. It’s also important to reach out to seniors, to understand their experiences. If anyone wants to have a conversation, then they can reach out to me as well.

In the lockdown, when there was a halt of 2–3 months, I was a little confused about the field to pursue. I did what I liked, applied for graphic design and product design internships and was doing that. In September, I decided to go for product management and consulting since I had a good CGPA and CV, so I began preparing for these two profiles.'),

Little was the first company I interviewed for and I got through. They shortlisted around 14 candidates on the basis of their résumé, after which we had a buddy-call session, in which they told us about how they will be going about the interviews. Then on Day 1 of Placements, we had our interviews over zoom. There were three rounds of interviews each about 10–15 minutes long.'),
(651, 45, 'Questions asked during interview rounds', 'What were the questions that were asked in interviews and the FAQs if there are any?', 'In the first round they asked my introduction and why did I want to join consulting, Then there was one short business case, which was a small profitability case. It was not a rigorous one, they just asked about the approach and recommendations, I did not have to go through the complete case. The first round went for 10–15 minutes, and after a gap of 10–15 minutes, I went for the next round. In the second round, I introduced myself again, in which they stopped me on my leadership qualities, PORs, values and some typical questions like what do you think a leader should do. Other than that, based on my resume, they asked me about my extra-curricular activities and about time management. Also, they asked me to guess my intern company’s revenue and recommendations for its improvement. There was a puzzle, which was a common one, from the book ‘Heard on the Street’. Then they asked me whether I had any questions for them, and the interviewer was a KGPian too, so we just talked about that. After a few minutes, they called me for the third round, which was with the Managing Partner of India and South East Asia himself. He checked my CGPA and then moved to my extra-curriculars. I told him about my achievements in dramatics and design, as the Inter IIT Dramatics captain, and the Design Head of Spring Fest and Inter IIT Sports Meet. I was also asked about my other shortlists and why I would prefer ADL over those companies. Regarding the FAQs, most consulting interviews have puzzles, guesstimates and business cases. There was no such separate HR round, but all three rounds had a few HR questions to check the culture fit.'),
(652, 45, 'Preparation strategy from now until December to maximize chances of selection', 'What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector?', 'For consult specifically, you need a combination of both CG and CV, an 8+ CG is preferable, but you should target for 8.5+, and in terms of POR and Co-Curriculars, they definitely help you in building a vivid CV, which helps in shortlist and even during the interviews, you get more things to talk about.

But you should have a diverse profile, be it good Internships or good PORs, or both.'),
(654, 45, 'Resources for preparation', 'Please suggest some resources for preparation.', 'I personally didn’t prepare much for consult, I was preparing for product management for which I joined Relay Campus which was started by our Alumnus, that helped a lot. Later when I was shortlisted for Arthur D. Little, I had very less time so I asked my batchmates and seniors who had prepared for consult and they made me practice a few cases. The resources which are most important are Victor Cheng YT videos and Audiobook of cases. ‘IIT Bombay’s Case Interviews Cracked’, ‘Heard on the Street’ and ‘Vault’s Guide to Case Interviews’ is good for case prep and guesstimates.'),
(655, 45, 'Consult and Product', 'Difference between consult and product', 'In my crude knowledge, Product management needs you to have knowledge about the customers, their needs and develop features corresponding to the needs aligning with the company’s goals. Consult requires you to deal more with strategy, business and management. Product management is an intersection of tech, design and business. Both of these profiles are rigorous in nature. The difference is that as a consultant your clients will be leading companies, NGOs and business managers, people leading the company. While in product roles you will be part of one company and deal with problems for only that company. Both roles, in my opinion, are such that each day is unique and interesting.'),

You never know what you like, unless you try it. Try something, if you don’t like it, try another. My only suggestion is to always be curious about fields and most importantly never do anything just to write it in your resume. Do what you enjoy doing and you will eventually get to know which field is best for you. What happened to me was that I had tried out Architecture, Graphic Design, Product and many other fields. Then I ended up in consulting, after all, these are wide fields that you cannot predict for yourself, but the best thing to do is try out and see for yourself if you like it or not. Aim for something that you like and don’t be much pressurised about placements. Why waste precious years of your KGP life, only thinking about getting a job, when there’s so much more to explore and learn from. Juniors can also reach out to me for advice, would love to help.

Talking about the process, it started with C.V. submission on E.R.P. and also on the website of the company. It was followed by a pre-placement talk, which was very informative and quite insightful about the profile and expectations from the student. After that came the Psychometric test, which was non-eliminatory. It was succeeded by a written test, which was all about writing an essay on a financial topic. Based on this test and our CV, a shortlist of about 20–30 students was released for the final interview process.

The time limit for about 30–40 minutes and a word limit of 500 words was laid. Before the test, I practised writing essays on some general financial topics with a time constraint, which helped me later. Talking about the interview process, there were two rounds of interviews of about 30 minutes each. First-round was completely technical, where questions related to corporate finance were asked. I was asked a few questions based on macroeconomic factors and their influence on the market, such as inflation because I had worked on these factors during my CDC internship. Then came the second round, which was a mix of HR and Technical questions. Again, the major focus was on corporate finance and macroeconomics.'),

Later, I started reading a few newspapers. All these helped me strike a good conversation with the interviewer. Apart from that, I want all pre-final year students to practice quant and quick math, which would be helpful in all the profiles. CAT papers and Quantitative Analysis for CAT by Arun Sharma, are always good for quant, while quick math is all about practice. If you are particularly aiming for this role, ensure to brush up on your corporate finance. Make sure you can justify everything that is mentioned in your C.V., as it is very important. During the last week of your preparation, have mock interviews with your seniors or friends about the companies you are aiming for.

The final outcome depends on the interview. Having cleared the CFA level 1 or higher would give you a good knowledge of corporate finance, which ultimately helps in the interview. But having these certifications indicates that one has a good hold over these topics. That might also bring more complex questions your way.

Then, start talking to the seniors about how to start preparing for particular companies and their interviews. At the same time, stay in constant touch with your peers who are aiming for the same profile. Try to help and motivate each other. Talking about the interview phase, it is necessary to know that it is not compulsory to answer every question throughout the interview. Sometimes, I had to say that, ‘I’m not aware of this topic…’ or ‘I’m not sure about the answer.’ Remember to stay calm, even if you don’t know something. Do not panic. Apart from this, I would also suggest being more interactive with the interviewer. Try to have a conversation, rather than a question and answer session. It would help in making the interview interesting.'),
(693, 40, 'What helped the most', 'What is the one important thing according to you that helped you get placed at P&G?', 'P&G has a very unique way of carrying out its selection procedure in which it checks if the candidate is fit to work in their culture rather than testing ones technical skills. As a result, having a diverse profile as far as the PORs, internships and projects are concerned and being able to understand the importance of one’s experiences helps.

Although P&G did not have an internal cut-off of 8 (It could be assumed to be 7.5), most other companies do keep it at 8. So I would say that having a CGPA of more than 8 is quite important.'),

After the test, they selected around 18 to 20 people for the interviews. The first stage was a group interview. In the interview round, they focussed on knowing about the virtues we have rather than asking us about the technical details of our projects. In this round, we were three people who were made to sit together for the interview but we had one-on-one conversations with the panel of interviewers. They asked us questions to know how well aware we are about our own experiences and the qualities we got a chance to work on thereby. The group interview was the most rigorous part of the selection process. After this, we had the last round, the personal interview, which had a pattern similar to the group interview.'),

Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'The online test: There were essentially 4 sections. The first part was a personality test to check how well the candidate fits the culture of the company. There were about 70–80 questions which needed to be attempted with great care. The questions mainly tested honesty and consistency. For example, the 5th and the 60th questions could have been framed differently but essentially mean the same. The answers should be as close as possible, which they would be if answered honestly. The next three parts tested one’s aptitude. The second part consisted of basic mathematics which was a speed test. The number of questions answered by a student in a given time was tested. The format of all questions was( _ x _ x _ ) + _ = 329 to be answered using digits from 0 to 9 without repeating a digit. The other two parts were also a test for aptitude, memory and speed. The test results and CV was analysed and based on this, students were shortlisted for. Interview rounds: The panel tested the candidate based on majorly two types of questions — Response to a hypothetical situation; Justifying mentioned capabilities by taking examples of situations handled by the individual Below are the questions (one of each type) that were asked to me- Type 1 You have to complete a project in 48 hours. You had planned to complete it right on time and have been working accordingly. Your boss suddenly asks you to show more results than planned which looks difficult to complete in the given time. How would you deal with this situation? Type 2 Give us an example of how you challenged the status quo and made a decision based on your opinion and experience. No technical questions were asked. It will work well in your favour if you focus your answers on your positions of responsibility, internships, competitions that you have been a part of to make sure that even work that you have done in the past is taken note of.'),

Apart from this, I also had an industrial internship at Vedanta Aluminium Limited where my projects were based on the application of machine learning on a core process. So I had a profile which was a mix of finance and bits of machine learning and core. During the placement semester, I tried coding but I didn’t like it. So, I thought of picking up my finance preparation apart from the regular non-technical preparation. I was preparing majorly for finance and I was shortlisted for Blackrock. When I got to know that I had cleared the test and got shortlisted for P&G, I started preparing for the same as well based on my conversations with people who had already got internships at P&G. Then I appeared for the group interview and cleared it. So I had 2 shortlists for the 1st day out of which I got into P&G before sitting for the BlackRock interview.'),

Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc.', 'These are the general resources that I used during my placement preparation. Aptitude: For tests, the usual constraint is the time limit. So, solving CAT material (I used TIME Practice books) helps. Geeksforgeeks puzzles, probability and statistics practice from books Heard On The Street, 50 Challenging Problems in Probability (puzzles from these books are usually directly asked in interviews of many Investment Banks) For most interviews, knowing one’s CV in and out is the most important prerequisite. Apart from this, interview preparation is mostly company-specific.'),

First of all, this year it will be difficult to get placed as compared to the previous years. I would suggest students focus more on competitive coding because most of the companies (about 70 to 80%) ask for coding in their tests. So it’s better if students do competitive coding is essential even if they are inclined towards some other sector if getting a job is their foremost priority as practising coding simply widens the student’s sample space of companies that he can sit for. For the core sector, apart from a good CGPA playing a very important role, it is important to pay attention to the internships/projects that the students do. In case the next semester happens to be online, seeing the bright side, I feel that students could do remote internships along with the semester as well. Having a core project/internship on their CV creates a good impact, as well as they, get to learn many things as well. Apart from this, for most chemical core companies the students should revise their core subjects well, like fluid mechanics, heat transfer etc.'),

Any advice or a general message for them?', ' I included most of the placement related points in the previous questions. Concluding the same, I would just like to say that the placement season essentially tests one’s patience and stress handling capacity. So, it is very important to remain devoted and consistent with the preparation throughout the semester to minimize the extra stress 1–2 weeks before the process begins.'),

Can we start with your introduction?', 'Sure! Hii Raza, good to know about your initiative. Communiqué is doing a great job in this regard. Regarding myself, I am Piyush Agrawal, currently a 5th-year student pursuing Economics at IIT Kharagpur. I recently got a full-time offer from KPMG for an Associate Consultant position in the Financial Risk Management profile.'),
(725, 47, 'Role Assigned', 'Piyush, can you brief me about the role which you have been assigned in the Company?', 'Sure, this is an excellent question because the role that KPMG came for this year was quite different from the ones that visited our campus earlier. They usually offer management consulting and analyst(Finance) roles. But this is a client-facing job in the domain of Financial Risk Management, similar to the risk profiles of Nomura and JPMC but the latter are more of an analyst role that is not front-facing. I think this is unique about the profile as it’s not restricted to analysing and modelling alone but also involves client interaction. And, I hope that sums up the role.'),
(726, 47, 'General recruitment process', 'That’s quite a diverse profile to work on. Can you share some insights about the recruitment process and general advice which will prove helpful to the aspirants for this profile?', 'First of all, there was a subjective screening test, with questions focused on Quantitative Aptitude. For this, hands-on at solving Prob-Stats and Econometric Analysis questions will be helpful. Post getting shortlisted, they took three rounds of interviews. One was the HR round, where they asked general questions like Strengths Weaknesses, Why KPMG? Why you?. The other was a technical round where I was grilled on Econometric Analysis, Derivatives and understanding of the Banking system. After clearing these rounds, we had a Partner Round. It moved around judging my personality, my familiarity with Finance jargons, and how I can deal with some practical situations like handling pressure and dealing with clients. Apart from that, I have seen candidates getting rejected because they were unable to explain their CV or don’t know about the role. So, I would suggest refrain from these common mistakes for the interview and prepare accordingly.'),
(727, 47, 'Preparation strategy to maximize chances of selection', 'That’s quite a robust answer. Now, how can a pre-final year student maximize their chances and what resources and suggestion you want to give to them?', 'I was also in the same position a year before, where I was going through the resources and suggestions to get a grasp and move forward. First of all, try and decide the profile you want to go for or have a priority order of profiles in your mind. I realised students usually try their hand in multiple fields end up having a lot on their plate, during placement preparation. But it’s essential to prioritise and take a call ASAP, which will give you a direction you want to head-on. Secondly, try to figure out and don’t forget your USP(Unique Selling Proposition). For example, I come from an Economics background, which gave me an upper hand in finance-related fields. Similarly, you may have done some internships, projects, courses or involved in extra-curricular activities, which definitely may have improved you & created the potential to get an edge in a particular domain. Apart from that, the resources are almost known to all. However, I would suggest reaching out to seniors who are currently working in your target companies and take suggestions on preparing for the interviews.'),
(728, 47, 'Weightage of certifications', 'What do you think about the weightage that certifications like CFA and FRM add to this role?', 'No doubt, these certifications play a positive role in getting you a job as it gives a sense to the industry that you are equipped with a certain amount of knowledge. Also, the job description of companies recruiting in the finance field generally includes that having a CFA or FRM certification would be a plus. Still, I would suggest discussing with your seniors before doing any Certifications.'),
(729, 47, 'Courses/MOOCs for preparation', 'Can you suggest any Courses in Kharagpur or online MOOCs which can help in the preparation for this profile?', 'Concerned to this Profile, as the test and interview moved around Quantitative Finance. So, courses like Probability and Statistics, Regression and Time Series Model from the Mathematics department and understanding of basic finance through online MOOCs or subjects offered by VGSoM and HSS department would be helpful. If someone wants advanced knowledge of finance, they can opt for derivatives and financial risk management subjects.'),
(730, 47, 'Regarding multiple PORs', 'You took multiple PoRs over the years, how did they help you during the Placements?', 'First of all, I feel lucky for being a part of various Extra-Curricular activities on campus. On the front of holding PORs, I was Secretary Hockey, became General Secretary, and then Overall Coordinator of Inter-IIT 2019. Also, I remained a part of GYWS and BClub. Overall I can say that these engagements helped me in shaping my Personality. I can recollect my Partner Round (at KPMG), where there were situational questions that I felt confident to answer due to the experience I had being at crucial PORs. It’s not that when you hold multiple PoRs, you will surely get a good opportunity at the Placements. People should not blindly take PoRs because they think they can in-cash them during placement. Instead, this is an opportunity to positively impact and simultaneously gain some important soft-skills like negotiation, problem solving and teamwork. PoRs aren’t meant to give a job, but they will provide you with an experience with your peers, which can’t be substituted.');

We are part of a 7-decades old institution, and yet you believe your problems or situation are so unique that not one of those alums/ seniors/ juniors/ profs has ever faced it? Reach out to them and talk your heart out. Also, be proactive and don’t be limited to yourself. Participate in competitions, network, travel, create something new or unique and take out some time for your body & yourself. Please bear in mind that this is not the end of the world. There’s a whole wide world apart from this. So yeah, Enjoy & keep progressing! Interviewer: Yeah that’s a very nice suggestion for juniors.

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'For placements, I had been aiming for all the finance roles. On Day 1, I was shortlisted for 4 companies i.e. IARC, BlackRock, Arpwood Capital, and Nomura. IARC is an asset reconstruction company and it is a subsidiary of Blackstone, which was my first preference. The profile for it was of an investment analyst. There were 5 rounds of interviews. 4 rounds were based on finance and the 5th was related to HR. BlackRock had 2 rounds; 1 technical and then HR. I got an offer from Blackrock and IARC, so I didn’t sit for the other two companies. IARC and Arpwood Capital had a test-based shortlist. The test consisted of questions based on logical reasoning, puzzles, basic English, and data interpretation. Blackrock’s shortlist was based on your CV. Nomura had theoretical math (MATH-1 & MATH-2) based test for the shortlisting.'),
(733, 49, 'Interview specific puzzles, questions and discussions', 'Could you please list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, HR questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'Basically, 4 types of questions are asked in all finance profiles. Firstly, the CV-based questions, which are quite common but important. One must be able to explain every point mentioned in his/her CV. You should prepare an answer to ‘Walk me through your CV, as it will be asked in almost every interview. Your answer should connect everything on your CV and explain why you did it. It is also better to have some previous experience in finance because it gives the interviewer some talking points. Then come the puzzles, guesstimates, and financial cases. Puzzles are mostly asked from books like Xingfeng Zhou and Heard on the Street. Puzzles based on expected probability are asked very often. Solving them is a must. Finance cases, which were asked in the IARC interviews, were mostly based on the factors on which investment in a company depends upon, both financial and strategic as well as relevant ratios and macroeconomic factors. Basic guesstimates are also asked. For example, I was asked to estimate the number of ATMs in my hometown in an interview for IARC. Thirdly, the basic finance questions cover all the fundamental topics such as beta, WACC, bonds, valuation, ratios, and their interpretation, basic accounting, etc. Coming to the HR rounds, there are some generic questions like, ‘Why finance after engineering?’, ‘What have you done to follow your interest in Finance’ etc. One must have a solid answer prepared to these questions as they will be asked almost everywhere. Apart from all this, BlackRock’s profile consists of a mix of financial analysis and modelling, etc. and so I was asked a bunch of python-based questions in its interview. So, a basic idea of coding in python or any other language is required.'),
(734, 49, 'Preparation strategy in pre-final year to maximize chances of selection', 'As a pre-final year student, what can students do to maximize their chances? Please suggest some strategies or resources for the same.', 'The best thing one can do to get into finance is, to build a good CV. This field is a bit challenging as there are only a few good companies in number as compared to Software. Also, their shortlists are very small. For IARC, there were only 9 students. Coming to BlackRock and Nomura, there were about 25–30. Thus your CV should be good enough to get shortlisted in companies like these because even if there is a test, CVs are also often taken into account on top of the test score. There are 3 major factors that companies consider: CG, interns, and projects. Projects in finance can be taken under Professors of VGSOM, IIM, etc. Interns are the most helpful as they provide you with actual experience. CG is also important and it is paid more importance than PORs and Extracurricular Activities. Financial Engineering courses can help in financial prep. Courses from Coursera can be taken for basic knowledge. Mergers and Inquisitions is a good youtube channel to learn about various terms and valuation techniques. Zerodha Varsity modules are a good source for an introduction to trading. Also, you can subscribe to Finshots and Investopedia- word of the day to learn more each day. You can also go through CFA and FRM books to learn more, they are freely available. Books like Hull and The Intelligent Investor are also good.'),
(735, 49, 'Weight of certifications', 'What do you think about the weight a certification like CFA or FRM adds to a CV for this role?', 'They are not completely necessary, to be honest. I have neither of them. Sources to study Finance are barely available on campus, except for VGSOM. To get a broad overview and study in a structured manner, one can definitely study the material for CFA and FRM. The certification can help you get some talking points in the interviews. The interviewer may ask questions that are directly picked from the syllabus of these if you’ve done them. They also serve as proof of your knowledge. If one has to choose between the two, I would prefer CFA to FRM, because it gives a broader view of finance.'),
(736, 49, 'Preparation for technical rounds after shortlisting', 'How did you prepare for the rounds involved once you were shortlisted?', 'There is not much time between the shortlist and the interviews. The shortlist for Nomura was announced just 24 hrs prior to the interview. The preparation for all these companies is more or less the same. One must start revising the basic concepts, financial ratios, and their interpretations and start solving books for puzzles about 1–1.5 months before the interview. In the time between the shortlist and the interview, revision can be done. You can practice some guesstimates with your friends who have prepared for consulting or you can refer to ‘Case interviews cracked’ youtube videos or the IIT B case book.'),
(737, 49, 'Parting advice', 'Anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'I have noticed that people don’t invest much time in making a CV, which later hurts. Students should draft their CV and can get it reviewed by seniors placed in similar fields. The CV must be aesthetic and crisp. One must be able to justify the points in their CV in-depth and you should avoid lying. Apart from its importance in shortlisting, most of the interviews are based on your CV so it is integral. Also maintain a good CG, A CG above 8.5 would be very comfortable, above 8 is still fine but below 7.5 will affect the probability to get shortlisted.'),

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', ' On the first day, I had given interviews with four companies. For Blackrock, they shortlisted students based upon their CV on the day before the interview. In the interview, they had three rounds. If a candidate qualifies for all the rounds, they have to sit for HR rounds, which lasts for around 20–25 minutes. It was more of a personality test. They asked me questions from my CV, my PORs, and my extra-academic activities, mainly NSS. Some situation-based questions were also asked.'),
(740, 48, 'Interview specific puzzles, questions and discussions', 'Could you please list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, HR questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'First: they were checking the candidate’s coding skills based on the language they had mentioned in their CV. I had mentioned R and Python in my CV, but they asked me to choose one, so I decided to go with R. He asked me about libraries and functions in R. He asked for function names and steps to carry out a particular task. Then he asked me about functions that have very minimal differences like left join, right join, inner join and outer join, etc. Second: The interviewer asked me CV-based questions (mainly internships and projects). Being from a financial engineering background, he asked me questions from finance like “what is bond valuation and how to do that? What are the variables used? What is the yield curve? Some questions were from corporate finance and derivatives. They also asked me questions based on my CV, as I had done two interns and many projects, so questions were asked regarding the same. Third: The interviewer asked me a guesstimate. The question was “to estimate the number of iPhone currently present in India.” He didn’t ask for a number but asked me to explain my approach to solve the question like ‘How would you start and what separations would you make,’ ‘what factors the buyer considers before buying the iPhone.’'),
(741, 48, 'Preparation strategy to maximize chances of selection', 'As a pre-final year student, what can students do to maximize their chances? Please suggest some strategies or resources for the same.', 'For pre-final year students, I would suggest that they should, first of all, decide in which profile they want to get into and talk to seniors about their interested fields who are already placed in that profile because that would give them a good idea like what are the things they need to know and skills they need to gain before placements, so that would be very helpful. Then, prepare a good resume, keeping it neat and clean, mentioning all the things, take help from seniors, and get it reviewed by them. I would tell you that while I was interviewed by IARC, the interviewer said that my CV was neat and clean, which was a plus point for me. So maintain a good CV. If you are sitting for a software profile, then you just need to be good at your coding skills, but if you are sitting for an Analyst profile, then in tests, questions would be based on quant, Logical Reasoning/Data Interpretation(LR/DI), ML, English. So you need to be good at all these skills. If you are good at your logical reasoning skills, then I would say you don’t need much practice, and if not, you need to practice from some online resources like the website “IndiaBIX” which would be very helpful in the test. Apart from that, If your English is not that good, then you have to improve that. After all, they have a section of English in the test, so try to improve before the placement if required and prepare for guesstimates from a book like a case interview because guesstimates would be asked in the interviews for analyst profiles. For practising probability questions for the interviews and tests, you have “50 challenging problems in probability” and “Heard on the Street,” these books are excellent sources. Many times you just get direct questions from these books or questions based on similar patterns in companies like GS, JPMC, etc. For puzzles, geeks for geeks is one of the best sources. For normal quant practice, Arun Sharma or any other CAT book would suffice.'),

Therefore I don’t think I can comment on this, but in general, how much I know is that these help you build a robust finance profile and add value to your CV. In my case, I would say that my being from financial engineering helped some way or the other in the placements.'),

The first shortlist I got was on 27th or 28th November, So there is a group called inter IIT placement where interview questions are shared by all IIT students and NIT students. You would get interview questions for all companies, and if the interview and test questions are updated, you would have an idea of which company is asking which type of questions. You will not be sure that you will be asked that same question, but you will surely get an idea about the kind of questions asked in the interview rounds. Also, for preparing for the HR round, I had prepared for typical HR round questions because if you are doing well in technical rounds and do not speak well during the HR round, then that may create a problem, So what you need to do is that search for HR questions on any website, there are so many websites, go to any website. You can see some basic questions like where do you see yourself in the next five years? Now next thing to do is to prepare a model answer for these types of questions. One more thing attending presentations would also help know about the company for which you have got shortlisted, along with this visit the website and see what work the company does, where the revenue comes from and all such basic things. If you think that you are going to get shortlisted for a particular company or you want to go for that company, then attending the presentation session will be very helpful. Every company more or less organizes this session. I prepared my CV thoroughly before the interviews.'),
(744, 48, 'Parting advice', 'Anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'I would say just one last thing that analyze yourself like How much you know and what skills you already have and how much extra work and efforts you need to put, accordingly preparing a schedule like how much time you need to give daily to get that skills and identify resources for that. Don’t go here and there as someone said prepare from that source then you are going to that, and then someone else said something, and you again change, so pre-decide what are the sources you are going to refer to and check whether these sources are actually helping you in getting the skill and answering the questions that would be asked in the test. Also, do not fake yourself in front of the interviewer. Have faith in yourself, and don’t get stressed. That’s all from my side.'),

My field of work during my internship was operations in Innovation Brewery which is part of the New Capabilities function. And now, after my PPO, I have been offered a role in the Operations function of AB InBev. My job profile is of that of an Analyst in operations. And if you speak about the different companies that one may target in the FMCG sector, I would like to mention that there are a couple of companies that arrive on Day 1 or Day2, like ITC, HUL, P&G. P&G, however, is a new addition and didn’t hire for internships during my time. Another set of firms which offer operations roles are different start-ups such as Blackbuck, Oyo and Udaan.'),

AB InBev is open to hiring from all departments, so everyone can write the screening test. After a preliminary test, 50–60 students were shortlisted and divided into groups of 10, for a group interview round. Now, group interviews are not exactly like group discussions, but more like an interview taken in a group as the name suggests. Everyone was asked about their strengths, their weaknesses and other basic interview questions. Interviewees were also asked to elaborate and discuss the points that they were putting forward. After the group interview, around 10 candidates were shortlisted and interviewed, and out of this, 50–70% of them were selected for the final offers in 2018–19 and 2019–20. They followed the same procedure for placements as well. Basically, this is the standard procedure that AB InBev follows. Firms like P&G also have a very similar process.'),

They also ask some basic questions about the company apart from these. In the final interview round, the set of questions varied from person to person. AB InBev was actually trying to select people on the basis of the projects that they had mentioned in their CV. One of my friends was asked questions only on Data Science because he was aiming for a Data Scientist role. He was asked technical questions purely on Data Science. Another one of my friends was aiming for a more supply chain and logistics oriented job, so he was asked questions based on that. I was more inclined towards innovation and operations, so I was asked questions from that domain. One important thing to notice is that this was possible only because the firm already had projects in all these sectors — operations, supply chain, data science, DevOps.'),
(748, 38, 'FAQs', 'What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for?', 'I think one underrated part of the whole process is the HR interview round. During my whole Placecomm tenure, I have seen people underrating/undervaluing the HR round, which I believe is very misplaced. And sometimes because of this, people end up not getting selected despite performing really well in the technical rounds. In the technical rounds/test, the company has already seen that you have the required skills, but it still needs to check you on the grounds of your soft skills, your ability to learn and collaborate. Therefore, it is extremely important to give emphasis on your soft skills and work on polishing them. This goes a long way in not just the HR Rounds of the interview, but also the technical rounds, where being able to communicate well and sell yourself creates a good impression. More so, if you are interviewing for an international offer. You also have to frame your answers in such a way that shows that you gel well with the principles and values of the firm. It will definitely be of help to visit the company website and read about their principles and what they look for in their people. Also, a lot of students with high CGPA are asked questions on whether they would like to go for an MS or PhD, i.e, pursue higher studies, and an incredible number of students aren’t able to answer this convincingly. Another question that one might face could be on the coherence of what’s mentioned on the CV. A lot of times students would have done projects in AI-ML, Finance or something unrelated to one another. Such CVs are prone to questions on why they have such varied projects/internships on their CV and it’s going to be helpful to keep an answer ready for that too. Additionally, one must know their CV in and out. You should be able to explain everything that you have put on your CV.'),
(749, 38, 'Preparation strategy', 'What was your preparation strategy?', 'Everyone has their own style of preparation. When I was preparing, I focused more on an Analyst type of role, where one should have a clear understanding of the mathematics and the statistics involved. In big firms, the interviewers basically focus on your process of solving the question. Your thinking process matters a lot. And if you want to go for an operations role, everything depends on your CV and you should be able to defend everything that you put on it. This is because operations is not a very technical role. It is mostly about the experiences you’ve gained on campus, and how your contributions would help the firm grow. Some internship-related questions that we asked me related to my CV were — How did you get this particular internship? What exactly did you do in this internship? What are the skill sets that you learned in this particular PoR? and similar questions.'),
(750, 38, 'Internship and placement in the pandemic', 'What are your views regarding the CDC internship and further placements scenario, in this pandemic period?', 'The Pandemic has definitely affected the firms financially, but they still might come to IIT Kharagpur, due to its tag, although it is true that they might not have as many opportunities for students that they had earlier. The number of offers will probably be lesser due to obvious reasons. But, the students should not lose hope. Be more proficient in communication, because they most probably will have an online interview where it is very important to communicate well. If you are not able to explain your idea to the person on the screen in front of you, then it won’t even matter if you have the best CV out there. So, for this scenario, I would suggest people focus a lot on their soft skills. Try to do mock interviews on video calls and phone calls to get some practice before an actual interview. This will help you understand what kind of pressure you will be facing, or what kind of problems you can face during a video call. Prepare for at least two different types of roles and make a proper CV specific to those roles. Don’t underrate the HR round. Also, there is nothing to worry about if your internship stands cancelled for this year, or there is a gap in your CV for summers 2019–20 because companies do understand that. Do not panic. It is important to contact as many seniors as possible, get your CV reviewed and prepare yourself to anticipate the questions that could be asked.'),

Both of them required you to submit a one-page CV and this time the submission of cover letters were waived-off. After CV submission, they shortlisted several of us for the further rounds. I don’t remember the exact number but I guess the shortlist was about 25–26 for BCG and for McKinsey it was about 14. After the shortlist there comes the buddy round. For BCG, the buddy round went around for a week, similarly, for McKinsey, it went about for a week and a half. The buddy rounds are supposed to be non-evaluative. I don’t think they actually were non-evaluative for BCG. But for McKinsey, they were certainly non-evaluative. In the buddy round, you are assigned a buddy from the company itself and you have to practice case interviews and other components of the interviews with these buddies. They help you with sort of a mock interview and give you feedback to improve your preparation for the final day. So after the buddy round which lasts for a week and a half, I did not make it to the next shortlist at BCG, though I received very constructive reviews after the practice cases. For McKinsey, there was a written test which was kind of an online game called “problem-solving test”. It was kind of a situational test in the form of a game which was to judge your problem-solving skills. This test was non-eliminative. After this test there were interviews. The interviews were spread across two days, on the first day I had a couple of interviews and the second day I had three interviews with the partners. So that was the whole process.'),
(754, 44, 'Interview specific puzzles, questions and discussions', 'Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'So there are two days for the first day you usually interview with engagement managers or senior associates. On the first day, the interviews were mainly focused on case interviews and there was also a part called personal experience interview which is HR type questions and on the experience listed in your CV. They try to question how your prior experience links to the job you’re applying for and how are you a good fit, They might also ask certain questions which would be completely HR sort of questions like mention a scenario in which you got out of an argument using logic or when you lead a team or that typical kind of HR questions. So after these personal experience interview questions, they jump onto the case. The case is like the usual case interviews that we can find for any consulting company and the time limit for that is about 20 to 25 minutes and the time limit is a bit strict. My role specifically was Business Analyst(McKinsey digital) so this is a new program they opened for the first time to KGP students. This position is aligned with the digital vertical of Mckinsey. So there was a slight part of Data Analytics in my first two interviews, it was not anything too fundamental just simple data interpretation and deriving certain results out of those data by observing patterns. The rest of this interview was the usual case interviews and it went on for about 40–45 minutes each in total. The interviewers were very friendly and they make sure that you are at ease when you are interviewing with them. So that’s about the first day. On the second day, however, I had to interview with the partners. I had three interviews that day. The first one went about an hour and a half, the second one was about half-an-hour and the third was about for 20 minutes. So in the first interview major part was about personal experience and questions, basically trying to justify your CV and all of the things you have done previously and why do you want to join McKinsey and start a career in consulting. They try to bring out whatever good skills you have. So my experience was majorly in Data Analytics and Natural Language Processing. They tried asking me questions about it and asked me in-depth about projects and in general about this field. So as to just to judge how much dedication I have shown in the work that I did. They just want you to be really good at something. So they try to judge you if you had done what you had done with your utmost effort. Then came the case interview, with the partners the case interview was not the usual one in which you ask questions and they answer and it goes on, in my case they just gave me some information and when I tried to ask more preliminary questions they just told me to work on the information that I had. So they want to check your basic thinking skills and logic and it can be solved with a very fundamental kind of an approach. There’s nothing sci-fi that you need to know. They just asked me elementary questions. My questions with partners had some components of Data Analytics for the first two partners and for the third partner it was completely a business strategy case. There was no Data involved in that and they don’t ask the cases as usual ones like the beginning to the end, they just give you a problem statement expect you to explain your way through solving them. With the partners how it went was they gave me some information and asked a very pointed question and you just need to answer the question that they asked and in the process show that your thinking skills are well developed and you can think very logically and you can convey what you think in a very clear manner, that’s what they focused on. They didn’t ask me any puzzles in any of my interviews. Solving the case interview was much like a team effort with the interviewer and you both are involved equally. So you need to think out loud about all of your approaches and to run it by him if you are going wrong at any point. They wanted to be really concise and speak only things that really do matter.'),

More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'By my personal experience I know that some people prepare generic questions and also you will find some of the generic questions like in HR kind of questions that are asked in consulting interviews in many of the major books. You can think about the pointers as to what you would speak about the thing when the question is posed to you. But I didn’t specifically prepare any of the answers, I just tried to be truthful in my answers and they can judge you if you are being truthful or you are just giving fundas. You need to justify your motivation to join consulting and why do you think this sort of a career would be for you because it’s kind of a non-usual job. Besides that, you need to show your leadership skills. One of the things I like to suggest is to work on communicating your thoughts clearly. Some people can think very logically but they can’t convey their thoughts clearly. Another thing is to keep smiling because it maintains good air with your interviewer.'),
(756, 44, 'Preparation strategy to maximize chances of selection', 'What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector?', 'I think the usual way for approaching consulting interviews is that you form a case group so the case group is a bunch of people who are interested in appearing for similar interviews as you are and you can practice a bunch of cases, you can observe others solving cases. So in that way you can learn from whatever mistakes they are making, you can replay what mistakes you do and get feedback from others. You can also read some of the books that are present, there are a bunch of good books on the topic you can refer to, you can solve guesstimates and some puzzles, just to get better thinking, to get your thoughts straight in an organised fashion.'),
(757, 44, 'Preparation for technical rounds after shortlisting', 'How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted?', 'So I didn’t do much preparation for consulting interview. After the shortlists were released, I asked for help a few of my peers as well as my seniors who had experience in interviews of such companies. I just did a few cases with them and got their feedback and I used their feedback to improve on whatever mistakes I’ve been doing. So that was very vital in improving my preparation. Also, the first company which I had appeared for which was BCG. I got very constructive and good feedback from all of the interviews that I gave. I tried to inculcate all of the suggestions they gave to me and improved on my approach. That’s basically all that I did.'),
(758, 44, 'Parting advice', 'Anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'o what I want to share is that I think there isn’t something very difficult when it comes to cracking such interviews, all you have to do is to be calm and composed and to organize your thoughts. Some practising with your peers and seniors will surely help but I would suggest not to aim to do all the cases because if you do too much you tend to overthink on usual things and connect them to a certain case that you had done. I would suggest everyone focus on their communication skills as well as solve simple problems and find logic in usual things, just keeping everything first principle. Just go with a clear mind and basic logic. I think that’s enough.'),

Basically, as a product manager, one has to work with the Business, Technical and the User Experience functions and look into identifying the needs of the customer, the end-to-end process of ideation and development of product solutions that cater to those needs and finally making sure that the product reaches the customer.'),
(760, 20, 'General interview process', 'Ok Kavita. Now as we have grabbed the basics of this field, could you describe the general interview process for your company?', 'First, there was a deck submission for which a problem statement(PS) was given and we got a window of 10–15 days to prepare it. Based on the deck, shortlisting was done. After that, we had our Campus interviews. There were 3 rounds. These rounds were related to Problem Solving, Product Thinking and Technical Understanding Cases.'),
(761, 20, 'Discussion about the first round', 'Thanks Kavita for explaining about the general interview process. Could you please tell us about the first round?', 'In the first round, we had problem-solving and product-thinking cases. In Problem Solving Cases, we have to find hidden problems and their solutions for a given product. For example the usage of an app has gone down by 10%, why? In Product Thinking Cases, we have to come up with creative product solutions. For example design Netflix for kids. To prepare for these, one can go through books like Cracking the PM Interview and Preparing for Product Interviews by IIT Madras. StellarPeers is also a good platform for this. You must also form a case group along with people sharing similar interests and solve cases together.'),
(762, 20, 'Discussion about the second round', 'That would be really helpful. Now can you tell us about the second round?', 'The second round was regarding technical understanding or products. I was asked questions about a popular app and how it worked from a backend point-of-view. Also, I had to list the technical elements that are at play to ensure that the app runs smoothly. I was also asked to describe how the algorithm of the app works and if I have to build a similar app, what are the technical elements and backend process flow I would incorporate. There were more such situational tech-questions and I was asked to describe some technical terms too. For this, one can refer to the book Swipe to Unlock and go through tech blogs of product-based companies.'),
(763, 20, 'Is coding required in this field?', 'So Kavita, is coding knowledge required for this field or an overview is enough?', 'It’s better to have some coding knowledge since a PM has to interact a lot with the technical team.

(764, 20, 'Discussion about the third round', 'Very well, then it’d be quite a nice alternative for all students who don’t like to code. Can you just enlighten us more about the third round?', 'In the third round, I was asked questions related to problem-solving strategies such as defining users for a particular app, determining KPIs to measure a particular parameter under certain constraints etc. Then the interviewer asked some questions regarding the field of product management, like “Why do you want to be a product manager?”,“Why are you the ideal candidate for this role?”,“Tell me about the time when you led a team” etc. It was more like a mentor to mentee discussion and he asked me if I had any questions too. I discussed with him the scope of this role at large.'),

(766, 20, 'How POR would be helpful?', ' Thank you Kavita for the insights. Does having a POR help in the shortlisting of the candidates?', 'I think if you have worked in a team, it really enhances your leadership skills and personality as a team player and that shows in the selection process.'),
(767, 20, 'Is it necessary to prepare for this field right from the first or second year?', 'I would like to ask, is it necessary to prepare for this field right from the first or second year?', 'For the first or second-year students, it is too early to prepare for any specific field and focus solely on placements. It is better to explore as much as possible and get a good understanding of the various areas that seem interesting and then make an informed decision for the future.'),

So, is there any message you want to give to your juniors in KGP?', 'I would like to emphasise that the campus really has a lot to offer in every direction and the best way is to explore and learn along with your batchmates. That way the learning process becomes much more enjoyable. The seniors in KGP are the best resources and they are extremely approachable, they can guide you about what is right and what is not. Keep doing something, anything! Just don’t let the most beautiful years of your life go in vain. Make the most of it! All the best!'),
(778, 23, 'General interview process', ' What was the general interview process for the companies that you aimed for? Also, how did you decide to go in the core profile?', 'One of the reasons why I chose core Mechanical Engineering is by the time I completed my 3rd year and I was ready for placements. I had a research internship in the core field, I had a few involvements with research groups in the core field and I felt that I have expertise in that field. So I think it is a very important decision to take because thinking a bit ahead in your career and kind of being in a field in which you are trained in or you’re an expert in or feeling like you have the highest potential in, will actually give you a kind of inner motivation. So I think one of the pros of choosing the core field is that you already have a lot of experience in fact and you already have prior expertise in that. But of course, it is true that the opportunities in the core field are a bit less. Although not less but they are not that rewarding in the first few phases as compared to other fields so kind of builds up an intuition that core fields are tough but I would like to say that there are a lot of companies which give adequate remuneration if you consider the kind of growth opportunities you have and one of the most timely argument that I would like to give to anybody to fix the issue between core and non-core fields is to first realise where your expertise is. Like you may feel that you’re a good manager and have a lot more managerial skills. Then I think the next question should be what are the core properties I want to build? Like you could be a good manager but how? What do you think you’re a good manager at? Are you good at managing designs? Are you good at taking design decisions? Are you good at taking innovative decisions? So that is how I think. A lot of whys’ need to be asked before deciding which field to choose and in my personal case, like on Day 1 of placements I had actually 3 companies in my mind. The first one was Sony, Japan which had a profile in Robotics, the next was ITC which was mostly managerial but as far as I can say it was mostly on Operations Management and third was Jaguar and Land Rover which was about automotive design and stuff. So I first decided what are my core competencies and I realized I have a lot of experience in automobile design and robotics of course. So that is how I started out so realizing where your expertise lies will actually help you in deciding your profile and which companies you want to go for. Also, before you go for companies and stuff you need to sit down and ask yourself a why question which is like suppose I want to go for consulting so my first question would be why? So I should list out a few factors like maybe I’m good at coming to innovative decisions, or maybe I’m good at seeing things from a broader perspective which is good for consulting or maybe that yeah I love a job which helps me in travelling. So after you have those things settled out you have to again ask yourself a why question like why am I good at innovation so you could know that ok well I can connect dots before people can and so on and finally why do you want a job that gives you the scope to experiment at various places and you think that you love innovating. So I think it boils these questions down to find a core pattern of your expertise and from that I think you should choose the company you want to go for.'),
(779, 23, 'CG requirement for core profile', ' Also, many of us have heard that for going into the core sector your CG should be high and then only you should aim for the core. So would you like to comment on that statement?', 'I think when you’re applying in core then there is something that I call as the Goldilocks zone for CG at end of 8th semester which for Mechanical is roughly around like I think if you have a 9+ CG it could but the interviewer in dilemma whether to take you or not because at 9.1 or 9.2 CG you can get into foreign universities and recruiters do not want to recruit you if you want to go for higher studies. So the Goldiloc’s Zone for CG is mostly around 8.5 to 9.1. And if you’re above 9, then the basic question you need to answer is why don’t you want to go for higher studies? So that is a question you always have in the back of your mind when you go with a high CG. If you’re below 8.5 or 8.6 then the question that comes to you is that what is the reason you have a low CG? So there the question actually falls in 2 places — the first one is you can say that I’m good in the core field, but some other subjects like Biology and Economics which I was kind of forced to take as a part of the curriculum are the reason, and the other thing is that you can always balance your CG with a mix of your aptitude. Like your work experience aptitude. And how that works is like you can say that I have worked in fields which required me to work on knowledge that is not much covered in my curriculum like e.g. you can say that I’m good in power systems and power systems are not covered in mechanical curriculum. So I think there’s always a place for rational decision on this part but the point is that you need to clear it for the interview round and for that if your CG is below 8.5 then it will be most good for you to do well in the pre-interview tests. That is where I think some of your focus should go to if your CG is between 8.5–9.1'),
(780, 23, 'Interview process for the companies you aimed for', 'Okay so my next question is what was the general interview process for the companies you aimed for?', 'In most of the companies I went for there were mostly 1 or 2 rounds of interviews. In JLR there were 2 rounds but I had to do only 1, I think I was fortunate in that part. In most of the interviews there were actually 3 parts. So the first part is where they ask you general process about mechanical engineering and in this part for some companies like ITC and somewhat in Bajaj Auto also that give you an option to choose your preferred subject and in others like JLR and Sony, Japan they come out with their own questionnaire to maintain uniformity across students. But whatever be the case you should always be ready for answering the questions out of you comfort zone also and in your comfort zone you should be able to answer questions which involve critical thinking. Another important thing in this part is most of the questions are actually related to practical applications such as what is the loading pattern? How do you pull that? So I think it is important for anybody who’s interested to prepare for questions on practical applications and critical thinking and this can be thoroughly developed through hands-on experience either via research groups, projects or internships. Next part of the interview is the CV round. In this round they run through your CV for what you’ve done. They try to find out what you have obtained from the work you did and they often ask you how you can replicate that experience in the scenario that they have set up for themselves. So for example I was working at University of Tokyo on Intelligent Vehicle Systems and they asked me that if Jaguar Land Rover wants to launch an intelligent vehicle then what is your role as a mechanical engineer in supporting that. So that I think is the exercise we need to do. So go through the details of the job you’re appearing for and how your past experience is linked to it. And the third and the final round is what people call the HR round and in my case, JLR asked me guesstimate questions, they asked me questions about how I manage teams and how I work with teams and what’s my overview on project management. I believe it isn’t something that can be built in a day but of course you can go through a lot of management books and other books you have interest in and that gives a fair idea of what you need to do. At the end of the day I think being able to find out things from your experience which relates to that question is all that you need to do.'),
(781, 23, 'Resources require for the preparation', 'Any resources you’d like to mention which you used while your preparation? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc.', 'So I was involved in various places and hence I learned a lot from there. But I think uniformly you need to revisit everything you’ve mentioned in your CV and you should know what you’re speaking of. Apart from that, for core I think you should go through a book that details out everything important which is just for the review before the interview to revise all the concepts. For the placement session it is important to give yourself a complete exposure to quantitative reasoning problems. At the back of your mind your analytical reasoning capacity should be good. And also if you’re in touch with those things then it’s easier for you to come up with a solution and also most of the people will also be open for the consulting profile so there are some mathematical models that you can use. Also, it is useful to have concise notes of the subject matter for a revision before the interview. Particularly for JLR, question sets from Gate entrance are a good resource for core mechanical engg. practice. Months before the placement session is it important to have daily practice of coding and reasoning question sets, these are crucial parts of the pre-interview tests. In this regard, having a peer group helps to remain focussed and derive motivation. Please avail test series if possible. Apart from all this some overview on guess-estimates and mathematical models will help.'),
(782, 23, 'Different strategy for preparation', ' So my next question to you is about your strategy of preparation. Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'For every company there is actually a kind of mindset which they come for like when you’re sitting for something like ITC we should be aware they are very much focused on your analytical ability. Which is like they want from you to solve problems that other people in your place cannot solve. However in JLR, when you need to provide them is that you’re an integral part of the team and you can work wherever it’s required and you have a decent exposure to the work. But in places like Sony, Japan what they want from you is that you should have a prior experience in your work area. So for every company you need to know what is it’s type of interview, you need to find out from people what is the kind of preparation that you need to do and you need to change your strategy, of course. You need to have a predefined strategy for each company.');

You have to justify to them how exactly their requirements are met by you? And my advice to anybody sitting for any company they want to is to form a strategy as we talked before which is particular for that company to know what kind of interview process it is and then strategize your resources in that manner and I think that is the exercise you can do for a month before your actual placements, So the day you fill in for the company you should actually have an idea about what they might ask like this interview is going to be about my CV, so I would have every point of my CV in my mind and I would have a defence for every word that is in my CV which they may ask about. Or maybe for company like JLR, I would know that I’m going to face a lot of questions on core mechanical concepts so let me have a cheat sheet where I have all those formulas and all those concepts written so that would actually give you the confidence to go in for the interview and that is the best advice, to have different strategies and have prior knowledge about every company that you’re going to sit for.'),

Also one of the most lucrative options of the core sectors is that you can work on your expertise and that what is more important for you is to know what you want to play out in these parts of your life. So it’s basically like seeing this resource in a broader perspective and being very focused on it. So you need to know what it is that you want to take after being at a company. Do you want to be in that job for 5–10 years? Or you want to be in management so you want to take off a little bit of time to go ahead. So that will give you a very clear idea about what kind of companies and what kind of field you want to go for. That I think is another important thing while choosing the company. So I think in the whole placement process, choosing your company is as much as being there in the interview because what it does is in the interview process it takes away much of your load off as you then have a lot of information which empowers you to go there and deliver almost everything that you know. So then you have a lot less surprises in the interview and you can actually give your best.'),

Please mention the shortlisting process for the same.', 'For day 1, I was shortlisted in 3 companies: Morgan Stanley, IARC (International Asset Reconstruction Company) and Blackrock. Morgan Stanley was my 1st priority. And, by the time I interviewed for MS and IARC, I had received an informal confirmation from MS. So, naturally, I didn’t appear for Blackrock. Now, both MS and IARC follow a similar scheme of recruitment: AMCAT (an aptitude test) score & CV based shortlisting followed by 4 rounds of Interviews. The AMCAT is essentially a watered-down version of CAT (i.e. quantitative, logical reasoning, data sufficiency etc.). The only difference is that while AMCAT is relatively easier compared to CAT, it has a much stricter time-bound. For instance, there’s not only a section-wise time-bound but also no flexibility of switching over questions even in the same section, i.e. you need to attempt a question to move to the next one & you cannot navigate back once you attempt it and move on. That is how they implicitly ensure that you don’t give a lot of time to a single question. Having said that, preparation is quite straightforward. There’s an ample amount of sample AMCAT videos on youtube (and quite representative, to be honest!). Both MS and IARC had an AMCAT, but MS also had some 3–4 additional sections. These were basic accounting (requires 2–3 weeks worth of knowledge of financial statements, revenue recognition etc.), listening, reading and speaking (you have to read out phrases shown on the screen, you’ll be given a topic on the spot and 30secs to prepare for it and speak over a minute etc.)'),

Across the 3 technical rounds, you meet with people with varied seniority ranging from 5 yrs. to 10 yrs. of experience. Usually, 1 or 2 of them are KGP alumni. That’s the way the cookie crumbles! The HR round happens at the last and only if you clear all the technical rounds. IARC had 4 rounds (and each round was a mix of both technical and HR). So you have four partners of different seniority in IARC, and each of them will interview you. In technical rounds, usually, you have people. For both MS and IARC, each round can last from 15–20 mins.'),
(795, 50, 'Describing past internships and projects', 'Can you please mention a brief idea of how to answer the questions based on our internships and projects that we have done?', 'I gave eight interviews that day, 4 for Morgan Stanley and 4 for IARC, and they always begin with the introduction. The first minute or two goes with the introduction, and then in the process, you may be asked to briefly go through your CV or some specific project/internship which piques the interviewer’s interest. Remember that the interviewer usually doesn’t have any great idea about what you did or why you did what you did. So, they’re looking forward to understanding exactly that. People usually make 2 mistakes here. First, they don’t practise/prepare for it upfront. They sort of feel that, “After all, it’s my work. I can definitely explain it. What’s the big deal”. Second, they often give too much emphasis on a very small detail of their project just because that was the most ‘difficult’ part for them while working on the intern/project. Don’t make these very common mistakes. Do rehearse each project/intern mentioned in your CV and don’t get lost in explaining the very nitty-gritty details of your work unless they specifically ask about it. I used a basic mental structure to whip each of my interns/projects: ‘What was the broader objective of the project?’, ‘What was the solution/technique used by me?’, ‘What was its performance?’ (e.g. saved costs, increased accuracy, saved time by automation, increased user engagement etc.) E.g. In one of my interns at a global bank, my job was to forecast an economic indicator in Australia. So, I should be able to tell the interviewer that why on earth does the bank want to do that (objective) — bank wants to do it because when they are giving out loans, they need to know how risky the loan is, and for that, they need to project or forecast certain variables, accordingly they will be able to keep some capital or cushion aside. Then, I would tell him that I used (technique) VAR or ARIMAX or LSTM etc. And, that VAR performed much better for [so and so reasons] than ARIMAX and LSTM by [this much]. In fact, they used my model for in-house forecasting purposes for the next quarter projections. That’s it! You don’t need to push him into the math of VAR or the R libraries that you had to use to do it. It’s only when he asks you about it that you go in deeper. Moral of the story: Break every intern/project into 3 things: Objective, technique and performance.'),
(796, 50, 'Puzzles, questions during technical rounds', 'Will you please mention the type of questions and puzzles asked in all the three technical interview rounds of Morgan Stanley?', 'Now, coming to the questions that were asked. It was probability puzzles, valuation and basic finance (like time value of money, annuity etc.). There was a probability question, with a follow up to the Monty Hall problem. There were three doors, one of them had the prize, and I was asked to choose one door among the three, and I chose B. He opened one among A and C and told me that I still want to go with B or you want to switch. I said yes, Sir, I will switch, because the probability of winning is ⅔. He asked what mistake did the game host make (which made my winning probability increase on switching)?. Hence, the answer to this question was, Because he is purposely choosing the gate which does not have the gift, he is giving away information by consistently not trying to give away information! In that particular round, he asked how much finance do you know? Not a serious question, and if you say I don’t remember much finance, then they will say ‘why have you chosen this role’ (sales and trading). I said I know ‘above average’, because I have done CFA Level 1, had a couple of certifications and also done an internship in finance. Then finally, at the end of the round, the interviewer asked if you have any questions for me. I asked him to explain the role (a very safe, straightforward question). This was the first technical round. Then the second technical round again started with an introduction. Then again, a probability question was asked on a dice, jee level problem. One of the questions asked to my friend was based on geometry, “if the triangle is a right-angle triangle, you know the three sides of it tell me the altitude dropping on the longest side?” We just had to equate the area! Then came a really interesting question, where he asked me, “where do you live?” I said West Bengal. He then asked,” Pick up one of your favourite buildings in West Bengal” I picked the British Embassy, a nice library. They said, “Value that building.” Now, it’s a question of valuation of real estate, from a finance perspective you should be able to tell them the first hint of it, that it has to be a DCF valuation, I asked him what is the purpose for which I want to buy it? Is it for living purpose or for commercial purpose?, so he said for commercial purpose (an approach: keep asking follow-up questions he may answer but may or may not give you concrete data/numbers), he is expecting to see how many relevant questions we can ask, so I continued with it and gave a proper answer, By this time the technical part of the round was over, then he asked,” I see you have done two minors, so do you know when the minor programmes started?”. For him, it was a nostalgic moment because the time when he entered college was when the minor first began, I said, “No sir, I don’t remember”. In such situations, you just pick up some conversation and go along. You need to be someone who can maintain the conversation, both technical and non-technical, without losing your professionalism. Morgan Stanley was looking for the profile where you have to talk to people up and down across the continent. Then comes the third technical round, Once again, I was asked for an introduction, and then he started with the question: “Why do you want to go into finance?”. Then he asked me, “I see you have done CFA,” so he asked me which subject is your favourite. I said “portfolio management”. He asked,” you are given two choices: 1 million INR straight away or 50,000 INR every year forever. Which one would you pick?”. Now, this is based on the time value of money. The catch is to remember that it depends on the interest rate (and not your mood!). So I gave my final answer as “Sir, if the discount rate in the market is less than 5%, I will go for 50000 INR every year, else I will go for one million straight away”. The interviewer followed up by asking, “What is the rate currently?”. I said, “ T-bills are trading around 6%. And these are the lowest discount rates in INR. So, definitely I would go for 1 million right away.” He then followed up by asking, “Fine... Sahil. You get your 1 million INR. How will you manage this money? Now once again, the reason why he asked this question is that I said earlier that I like portfolio management. So he was testing me. I asked two-three follow-up questions and ended up giving an elegant process-oriented answer like ‘investor preferences’, ‘capital market expectations’ (instead of something very crude like ‘20% in stock x and 80% in bond y’), which is what I guess he was looking for. And there ended all the three technical rounds.'),
(797, 50, 'About HR rounds', 'What is the purpose of the HR round? What type of questions are asked in this round? What is the nature of this round?', 'Finally, the easiest of the rounds: HR round. The whole purpose of this round is to see if the person is presentable, she knows that you have cleared the technical rounds, so she is in no way interested in knowing how smart you are. She just wants to see that, can you become a part of an organization that is ten times or 1000 times larger than you? So the questions that are asked are very standard. The first question is- introduce yourself. Why do you want to join Morgan Stanley? What are your strengths? Why should we hire you? Do you know the company? They even asked me if I am comfortable operating in the night shifts because they have a very fluctuating schedule because I will be working for US or Hong Kong clients who operate in a different time zone. These are very standard HR questions, and if you know enough about yourself, everything will go smoothly.'),
(798, 50, 'Importance of certifications', 'What do you think about the weight a certification like CFA or FRM adds to a CV for this role?', 'I personally believe that everyone should have a decent amount of financial literacy not just for placements but life in general. And, CFA Level 1 is the highest quality way there is towards that aim. It is conducted 4 times a year. No doubt it is costly, but there are scholarships available and many people are lucky to get one. For example, in my case, I got a scholarship in CFA level-2, so you can apply for scholarships and test your chances. Now suppose you don’t get a scholarship. You should again think once how passionate you are about this. Since you are not getting a scholarship, that means you are supposed to pay for it. If you believe that you are passionate about this, sooner or later, I want to learn about this, then pay it because it’s worth the money. Still, if you think that — ‘I am not so sure about it, in that case, earlier I used to say, ‘go for Varsity modules by Zerodha’.But now I say that there is another option, i.e. CFA investment foundation, This charter is given by the CFA Institute itself. The difference is: CFA is a very comprehensive exam having three levels, and you have to pay for it. In contrast, the CFA investment foundation is free of cost, and you go on the CFA institute website, you make an account free of charge. You can easily enrol into the CFA investment foundation, whose content and coverage is nearly 20% of the CFA Level 1. Once you are done with the material, then tests are conducted, a short online test, if you clear the test you will get the certificate, and the whole thing was free, the only thing you invested was time and energy, so this is the second option for people who are not so sure & just wanna have a peek into finance. If you really want to go into finance while at IIT, then you need to pursue a charter/ certification, there is no other option, so if you are honest and you want to pursue something in this field, you should do CFA level 1. I don’t recommend FRM for the simple reason that FRM is financial risk management, and you will be able to do this properly only if you know some finance already. I have friends who have done FRM and have themselves admitted that CFA would have been a better certificate to pursue during IIT. So I do not recommend this course if anyone wants to learn finance. This is all from my side.'),
(799, 25, 'How and when to decide core profile', 'How and when did you decide that you wanted to get into the core profile?', 'Right from my second year, I started exploring the core and non-core sectors. At the end of the second year finally, I felt that I was more inclined towards the core sector as I always wanted to make my career in a field in which interaction with people was more than interaction with machines. I knew that I couldn’t sit in front of a PC for 4 to 5 hours and do coding. One plus point of Civil Engineering is that in the core sector, candidates have both options, either you can go to the private sector or to a government job. In the private sector, the work pressure will be a bit higher but at the same time, there will be more learning opportunities. While working in the private sector you will feel like an entrepreneur after a few years of experience as you will be handling multi-crore projects equivalent to the size of small-cap companies. It is a high-risk job where a single small mistake can cost you lacs of rupees, and therefore, the remuneration will be high too. As a fresher in this industry having zero experience and zero risk handling capacity you will be paid low initially but, with experience, you can achieve exponential career growth. If you see the government sector then UPSC (ESE) is the best achievable option. It gives you techno-managerial job opportunities as well as social privileges. Work pressure is a little less in comparison to the private sector. Considering all these factors, I started preparing for UPSC(ESE), a competitive exam conducted by UPSC for recruitment of candidates in various engineering positions in government departments. Accordingly, I did my compulsory internship in a PSU only. In my third year, I was wholeheartedly preparing for the ESE/GATE exam and I was not targeting on-campus placements, but in late November and early December, I feared to miss out on any available Opportunities during the campus placements. I was in a great dilemma as my main exam was in early January only and I knew that the placement phase is very turbulent and could harm my preparation for the exam, but I finally decided to put in efforts for the core companies visiting the campus.'),
(800, 25, 'General interview process', 'What was the general interview process for the companies that you had given interviews for?', 'I had appeared for 3 companies and in every company, the general interview process was almost similar. Firstly, there was a resume/CV selection round, then an aptitude test and then one round of personal interview.'),
(801, 25, 'Is it true that one should aim for core sector only when CG is high', 'Is it true that a high CG is required to pursue your interests in the core field?', 'Yes, it is true that there is a requirement of higher CGPA for core sectors but the range depends upon the position you are applying for. If you are going for the R&D team then definitely higher CGPA students will be preferred by the recruiters. If you are going for the execution/operation team for the techno-managerial job then CGPA above 8 will have more chances. Mostly Civil core companies hire UGs for techno-managerial work only. Design and research are expected from PGs or PhDs.'),
(802, 25, 'Resources require for the preparation', 'What were the resources that you while your preparation? Eg- any additionals, online courses etc. And how did they help you?', 'Since I was preparing for the UPSC(ESE) so I was following study materials of a coaching institute that helped me a lot in the departmental subjects. I relied completely on the information available in those materials to revise my core topics. And it helped me a lot in the interview of L&T Construction too.'),
(803, 25, 'Different questions asked in the interview', 'Can you list some of the questions that were asked to you during the interview?', ' In the interview with L&T Construction, they mostly asked about the in-depth details of projects. Design sessional project is important as it gives a good idea of the construction of multistorey buildings. They asked me about the location of the structure, its zone of earthquake, wind zone etc. You need to be accurate with numbers and values. I remember my interview took place through a VC and they cross-checked my answer on the internet about the earthquake zone of the location told by me. Practical questions from the internship experience were asked. Basic questions from the Course ‘RC structures’ like Why should we do curing?, 7-day strength percentage?, What does M20 Mean? Etc. were some of the questions that they asked. They were expecting full definition type answers from me. Never forget to revise EIA if you have mentioned in your resume. It is a very hot topic in the construction industry in India these days. None of the companies asked any guesstimates or analytical questions. I did not get much time to practice aptitude problems but I referred to RS Agrawal for aptitude part in the time available to me.'),
(804, 25, 'Involvement in KGP ', 'What were your involvements in KGP and how did they help you?', 'I have been an active member of the organising team of ‘Megalith’, which is the departmental fest of the Civil Engineering Department. In my view societies and groups help in making a bigger friend circle, personality development and many other things depending upon in which field that society/group is active. I guess any other involvement, other than academics will not help you in any way in civil core companies placement, but definitely having its experiences will help you at your workplace.'),
(805, 25, 'Advice for juniors sitting for placements this year', 'What advice would you like to give your juniors sitting for placements this year?', ' This year there will be some impact on hiring due to the recession. But remember, your technical skills are your assets. Make your technical skills strong in a particular field. Take the help of your seniors to get an overview like what type questions were asked and general interview process etc. During preparation, take out some time and have a talk with your friends. This will help you and your friend feel positive. Don’t worry too much, everything will be good at the end.'),

And perhaps give them a message?', ' I would only like to say that, explore your interest while you are in KGP but at the same time be cautious and avoid wasting time in the name of exploring. Make friends, learn technical skills and be positive all the time. Baki toh KGP ka tempo high rehta hi hai.'),
(830, 27, 'How to decide which profile to prefer?', ' How did you decide to go in the core profile considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about?', ' I’ve always been interested in the field of aerospace and aeronautical engineering.During my five years at IIT Kharagpur, I have had a diverse experience. I got to know what particularly interests me in Aerospace Engineering. I enjoyed understanding the thermodynamics and aerodynamic concepts of propulsion systems and experimenting on them through my projects. I even forayed out of my comfort zone into non-core domains like Finance and Data Analytics. I took a liking to the financial subjects.While it’s true that people fancy coding and data-analytics jobs more, I strongly believe that the core profiles were and shall remain evergreen. I chose a core job because I felt it to be my calling at this moment. I guess I was more inclined towards those from the beginning as my father was in ISRO. His profession excited me enough to take up this field and I ended up choosing Aerospace Engineering here at IIT Kharagpur.'),
(831, 27, 'General interview process', 'What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for?', ' While I was more inclined to take core-jobs, and I had more than sufficient research experiences to hold my ground in the interview, I wasn’t confident about getting offers from core companies initially due to my mediocre CGPA. Core companies usually expect you to have a sound academic score, and while a 7.5+ GPA is acceptable, an 8+ GPA candidate with similar research experience would always have an upper hand. As a result, I took up the opportunity of applying in other profiles apart from Core. I was selected for the interview procedure of Halma PLC, JP Morgan on Day 1 and AB InBev, Fractal and Honeywell on Day 2. To be honest, the interviews of the Day-1 companies were more exhaustive. JP Morgan held 4–5 rounds each focusing on a particular field. The first round was mainly CV-grilling followed by a coding round where they asked you about searching algorithms and coding puzzles. Preparation from G4G comes in handy over here. This was followed by a round focussed on Quant, where you are asked questions from Prob&Stats and puzzles. Sadly, I couldn’t hold my ground well in this round and wasn’t shortlisted for the next one. Halma also had an exhaustive interviewing procedure. An online test(quantitative and verbal reasoning) was conducted, followed by two psychometric online evaluations. This was followed by a short buddy session with a Halma representative where the shortlisted candidates could find out more about Halma and what life is like in the program. This was followed by a group-discussion round on Day-0 and the shortlisted candidates had to go through a thorough interview session on Day-1. The interview session is unlike any other. This is not a technical round, but more an extensive psychometric round where you are asked about your strengths and weaknesses in detail. They followed an experiential questioning technique, where the answers don’t have a specific right or wrong. Questions like what a person learned from his past projects/experiences, how he handled stressful situations, and how he approached solving open-ended problems. It was an exhaustive round that lasted for around an hour to an hour and a half depending on the candidate. The interview procedure for Honeywell included an online test(technical and quantitative), and two interview rounds (Technical and HR). The technical interview began with CV grilling where they asked about the core projects I worked on and went into finer details about some of them to grasp if the candidate has in-depth knowledge about that field. I was grilled on my MTP project and my work-experience in TeamKART, along with my participation in an international competition. Post the CV grilling, I was asked basic questions on thermodynamics and propulsion. This was followed by the HR round, where they tried to find out how well I knew about the company(if I was genuinely interested in joining them) and if I’d be a good fit for the team.'),
(832, 27, 'Is it true that one should aim for core sector only when CG is high?', 'Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement?', 'There is no denying the fact that CGPA matters a lot, specifically for core profiles. If there are two candidates with equally sound technical experience in their CV but one has a higher CGPA, he might still be preferred even if he doesn’t have PoRs or extra-curricular activities to show in his CV. But keep it above 8, and you’re sure to get shortlisted for most of the companies provided that you prepared for the preliminary tests and have done well enough in those. With that being said, campus placements are anything but predictable.'),
(833, 27, 'Resources require for the preparation', ' Any resources you’d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc.', 'For the people more inclined towards core jobs, make sure that you are well-versed in your technical field, and I cannot stress enough how important this is. You should obviously know your projects inside out, and be comfortable in explaining them in detail. Most of my electives in my final and pre-final years were mainly in the turbomachinery field and that helped me a bit at Honeywell. Some programming knowledge wouldn’t do you any harm.'),
(834, 27, 'Different strategy for preparation', 'What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'Since I was studying for both core as well as the non-core profiles, I had to modify depending on the tests and the companies for which I was shortlisted. I initially studied for the core subjects making sure that I cover all the bases for interviews at core companies like Honeywell and Airbus. Post that I studied for quantitative and focused on my coding skills. During the last week, I focussed more on the quantitative and coding questions since I was shortlisted in non-core companies and in Honeywell for the first two days. Since I had already prepared my core subjects, I was confident about the technical sessions in the core companies.'),

Be ready to face rejections and surprises. Placements are anything but predictable, and with the looming threat of deep recession, it’s even more so. There is no telling how the placement session would turn out, but there are a few things you can do: ensure that you duly utilize this time strengthening your skills and learning new ones; efficiently utilize the resources that IIT is offering you; prep well for the preliminary placements test. You’ll have to brush up your coding and quantitative skills for both the interviews and tests, so start early with that. Make sure that you have good networking with the KGP Alumnus so that in the worst-case if the placements don’t go so well this year, you’ll have external support from them.'),
(836, 27, 'Advice for general KGP public', 'What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them?', ' KGP provides a pretty good platform for you to excel in your career. Make sure to utilize it well. Explore as much as you can in the initial couple of years of the college. The institute offers opportunities in all the fields, so try them all out. If you want a research exposure, apply for FTs; if you need corporate exposure, apply for internships in start-ups. Once you have explored enough and have a basic idea about the profiles/fields you are interested in, contact your seniors and try to understand the scope of those fields and if you are the fit for it. Make sure that by the time you reach the final year, you have enough experience and knowledge to hold your ground in the placement sessions.'),

The questions might vary but the underlying concepts will be the same. An important skill that managers need is to convey complex information in a structured way. Communicating structurally is very important to get your point across. Case interviews show how you think. The more cases you face, the more you enhance your structural thinking.

If you aren’t able to give a solution in the allotted time, it won’t give a good picture. So be quick while solving cases. Find people who’re really good at solving cases and practice with them.'),

(865, 18, 'Nature of the interview process', 'What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds, the nature of the interview process, and your experience.', 'I can tell you a bit about Mckinsey. Wouldn’t focus on the rest of the firms as other folks can answer about them better. Basically there are three rounds: A CV shortlist round, an Engagement Manager (EM) round, and a final Partner round. The number of applicants keeps getting funneled in all 3 rounds. In our case, 13 got through CV shortlist into the EM round and 4 went into the final Partner round. Notably, after the CV shortlist round, there is a period of around 2 weeks/10 days where you are allotted buddies. These buddies are people at the firm — associates or senior associates who have completed around 2 to 3 years in the firm. These guys help you out in the process. They talk about what kind of questions you can expect and how to prepare for them and what the partners are looking for in later rounds. For me, the buddy experience was really good. Both my buddies were super helpful. I think that Mckinsey is really good at this part because the buddies step out of their way to help you out. One of my buddies talked about very practical kinds of things, what to do and what not to do in an interview. He had also shared some of his case questions with me, which turned out to be very helpful. I also find it crucial to point out that the Buddy sessions are entirely non-evaluative at McKinsey and they’re an opportunity for you to know more about the firm. Now after the CV shortlisting and buddy rounds you move into actual interviews: EM round and if you make it through, then into the Partner round. Both EM and Partner rounds have 2 or 3 interviews. You’ll have a 3rd interview depending on whether the firm is able to build conviction about you from the first 2 interviews or not. I’ll explain both EM & Partner rounds: The Engagement Manager (EM) level folks are one level up from the associates. They have spent around 4–5 years in the firm, and they have a very good understanding of how Mckinsey operates. I had 2 interviews. I suspect that Mckinsey has some protocol in which one interviewer is a KGP alum, and the other interviewer is from some other college. I think that they do it to build greater conviction on you from both an internal and an external perspective. My first interviewer was from KGP and had gone to IIM, and specialized in the Financial Services vertical. The other interviewer was from BITS and IIM. I remember that the first interview question was about Retail Lending, the client’s loan book had increased but profits were down. The second interview question was about the stagnant revenues of a client’s hotel in an otherwise burgeoning Hotel Industry. I think I did fairly well on both of them. Then I moved to the Partner round with 3 more applicants. Partners have a minimum of 7–8 years of experience at the firm, they lead case teams and bring in new clients. Partner rounds are more conversational. They just gauge whether you can have a lively chat for about 20–25 minutes without getting them bored. Again, a similar type of mixture in the interviewers, my first interviewer was an IIT Delhi/IIMA alumnus and the second was an IIT KGP/IIMA alumnus. The first interviewer had been in consulting for the last 25 years and was extremely experienced. He was from IIT Delhi, then IIM Ahmedabad, and had been consulting for years more than my age. He first asked me about my prior internship experience. I had talked about ITC, where I spent my previous summers, and explained how I had generated buy-in for my proposals by co-creating a solution with the senior management. I remember that he said that this was something they generally do at McKinsey. The case question was around electric vehicles and clean energy that finally ended up in a free-flow discussion about an article that the Partner had written. He even emailed me the link to his article after the interview. After that, I had my final round with Aditya Sharma, a partner from IIT KGP/IIMA. He’s one of the youngest partners at McKinsey and a Forbes 30u30. My initial conversation was around what I have done on campus. We talked about Alumni Cell and he mentioned that he was on the Founding team of Alumni Cell years back. We also talked about IIT Tech Ambit, a publication I’ve founded in KGP. After that, he asked about an instance where I had resolved a conflict and I gave an instance from my time as the Inter IIT Cultural Captain. My case was also around that. He asked me how I would prepare Indian players for the next Olympics tournament If I became Head Coach of the Indian Olympics Team. This was a seemingly unusual case but we worked through it together. Next, he asked me to guesstimate how many hotel beds in India which was very straight forward. That was it. Next, I was notified on phone by the HR that I was in. :)'),
(866, 18, 'FAQs', 'What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', ' I think any McKinsey interview has two components, first is Behavioural-questions, and the second is case-based. I’ve heard that, unlike other firms, McKinsey gives an equal weightage to both parts of the interview. Behavioral questions are more or less HR questions. Questions like “What was your greatest accomplishment in your internship ?”, “What did you learn the most?”, “Have you worked in small teams of four or five peoples?”, “What are the major things that you learned from it?”, “An instance of leadership?”, “One instance where you resolved a conflict?”, “Strengths, weaknesses?”, etc. I am only talking about Mckinsey’s perspective and the kind of HR questions that I encountered in my interviews. It makes sense for them to identify these kinds of skills because they want to see them in a Business Analyst as you will be working in small teams mostly and would need to resolve conflicts at various stages. It went quite well for me. I had prepared well on the behavioral part and had thought through my experiences in four years of college. It’s important to remember stories from your past experiences and structure them well when these questions are asked. For instance, when asked about the resolution of conflicts I had mentally prepared to talk about an instance from my time as the Inter IIT Contingent Captain. On the second part of the interview, which is case-based questions, I think Mckinsey is different from the rest of the firms because the rest of the firms have a lot of focus on conventional case solving, and they want you to be very good at that, but in Mckinsey, it’s much more conversational, and you need to be very structured in your thoughts. They generally won’t even ask conventional case problems, especially in the Partner rounds. Key point is to go MECE all the way in everything that you say in your interview. There are a couple of books that people generally refer to like “Day 1.0” and “Case interviews cracked.” These two books have a lot of Cases inside them, the majority are conventional cases but there are some great unconventional ones too. It’s good to go through them and practice with a partner. I think it is more important to be structured & MECE in the way you are presenting, and you should able to have a good conversation with the person itself.'),

But when it comes down to dedicated case prep, I think one month is enough for it because it keeps your thoughts fresh. You are in practice — no need to begin the case prep 3–4 months before the placement season. I think one month is sufficient for the prep for case interviews.'),
(868, 18, 'Preparation for technical rounds', 'How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted?', ' I talked about a couple of books. Those books are good enough, and I think we should form a case group of 3–4 people. I had a case group of 4 people, and we used to do cases between us. It was a great experience as my team members were awesome at solving cases and I have learned a lot from them. It makes sense to form groups where all members have good chemistry but bring different perspectives and styles on the table.'),
(869, 18, 'CV Shortlisting', 'As the consulting shortlisting process is extremely competitive, as a 1–2rd year, how do you build your profile for consulting?', 'That’s a good question. The first thing you should keep in mind to get placed in good consulting firms is that your profile/CV should have spikes. Your profile basically has four broad sections — Academics, Internships, Leadership/PORs, and Extra Curriculars. Mckinsey looks for spikes in your CV — either you should have a huge spike in one section or have moderate spikes in most sections. Academic spikes could be a DR1/2 and/or papers published in top conferences. Moderate spikes may be an 8.5+ GPA. In internships, day 1 interns and FTs could help you well. To my belief, prior internships in either financial services/good banks or in more operational kinds of roles at ITC/HUL/P&G can be great. Software internships may also count. For leadership/PORs, I think working in a good Cell or probably being a GSec will add a big spike to your resume. McKinsey also gives a lot of weightage to entrepreneurial endeavors that you may have undertaken. In Extra-curriculars, If you have won a cup or medal in Inter IIT, or even Inter Halls, then it will add a spike to your profile. That’s it. All the best! :) Feel free to drop me a mail at utksn15@gmail.com to discuss in more detail.'),

(871, 27, 'Why core..?', 'How did you decide to go in the core profile considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about?', 'I’ve always been interested in the field of aerospace and aeronautical engineering. I guess I was more inclined towards those from the beginning as my father was in ISRO. His profession excited me enough to take up this field and I ended up choosing Aerospace Engineering here at IIT Kharagpur. During my five years at IIT Kharagpur, I have had a diverse experience. I got to know what particularly interests me in Aerospace Engineering. I enjoyed understanding the thermodynamics and aerodynamic concepts of propulsion systems and experimenting on them through my projects. I even forayed out of my comfort zone into non-core domains like Finance and Data Analytics. I took a liking to the financial subjects. While it’s true that people fancy coding and data-analytics jobs more, I strongly believe that the core profiles were and shall remain evergreen. I chose a core job because I felt it to be my calling at this moment.'),
(872, 27, 'Interview process', 'What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for?', 'While I was more inclined to take core-jobs, and I had more than sufficient research experiences to hold my ground in the interview, I wasn’t confident about getting offers from core companies initially due to my mediocre CGPA. Core companies usually expect you to have a sound academic score, and while a 7.5+ GPA is acceptable, an 8+ GPA candidate with similar research experience would always have an upper hand. As a result, I took up the opportunity of applying in other profiles apart from Core. I was selected for the interview procedure of Halma PLC, JP Morgan on Day 1 and AB InBev, Fractal and Honeywell on Day 2. To be honest, the interviews of the Day-1 companies were more exhaustive. JP Morgan held 4–5 rounds each focusing on a particular field. The first round was mainly CV-grilling followed by a coding round where they asked you about searching algorithms and coding puzzles. Preparation from G4G comes in handy over here. This was followed by a round focussed on Quant, where you are asked questions from Prob&Stats and puzzles. Sadly, I couldn’t hold my ground well in this round and wasn’t shortlisted for the next one. Halma also had an exhaustive interviewing procedure. An online test(quantitative and verbal reasoning) was conducted, followed by two psychometric online evaluations. This was followed by a short buddy session with a Halma representative where the shortlisted candidates could find out more about Halma and what life is like in the program. This was followed by a group-discussion round on Day-0 and the shortlisted candidates had to go through a thorough interview session on Day-1. The interview session is unlike any other. This is not a technical round, but more an extensive psychometric round where you are asked about your strengths and weaknesses in detail. They followed an experiential questioning technique, where the answers don’t have a specific right or wrong. Questions like what a person learned from his past projects/experiences, how he handled stressful situations, and how he approached solving open-ended problems. It was an exhaustive round that lasted for around an hour to an hour and a half depending on the candidate. The interview procedure for Honeywell included an online test(technical and quantitative), and two interview rounds (Technical and HR). The technical interview began with CV grilling where they asked about the core projects I worked on and went into finer details about some of them to grasp if the candidate has in-depth knowledge about that field. I was grilled on my MTP project and my work-experience in TeamKART, along with my participation in an international competition. Post the CV grilling, I was asked basic questions on thermodynamics and propulsion. This was followed by the HR round, where they tried to find out how well I knew about the company(if I was genuinely interested in joining them) and if I’d be a good fit for the team.'),

Would you like to comment on that statement?', 'There is no denying the fact that CGPA matters a lot, specifically for core profiles. If there are two candidates with equally sound technical experience in their CV but one has a higher CGPA, he might still be preferred even if he doesn’t have PoRs or extra-curricular activities to show in his CV. But keep it above 8, and you’re sure to get shortlisted for most of the companies provided that you prepared for the preliminary tests and have done well enough in those. With that being said, campus placements are anything but predictable.'),

You should obviously know your projects inside out, and be comfortable in explaining them in detail. Most of my electives in my final and pre-final years were mainly in the turbomachinery field and that helped me a bit at Honeywell. Some programming knowledge wouldn’t do you any harm.'),

I initially studied for the core subjects making sure that I cover all the bases for interviews at core companies like Honeywell and Airbus. Post that I studied for quantitative and focused on my coding skills. During the last week, I focussed more on the quantitative and coding questions since I was shortlisted in non-core companies and in Honeywell for the first two days. Since I had already prepared my core subjects, I was confident about the technical sessions in the core companies.'),

There is no telling how the placement session would turn out, but there are a few things you can do: ensure that you duly utilize this time strengthening your skills and learning new ones; efficiently utilize the resources that IIT is offering you; prep well for the preliminary placements test. You’ll have to brush up your coding and quantitative skills for both the interviews and tests, so start early with that. Make sure that you have good networking with the KGP Alumnus so that in the worst-case if the placements don’t go so well this year, you’ll have external support from them.'),

If you want a research exposure, apply for FTs; if you need corporate exposure, apply for internships in start-ups. Once you have explored enough and have a basic idea about the profiles/fields you are interested in, contact your seniors and try to understand the scope of those fields and if you are the fit for it.

(900, 25, 'Why Core..?', 'How and when did you decide that you wanted to get into the core profile?', 'Right from my second year, I started exploring the core and non-core sectors. At the end of the second year finally, I felt that I was more inclined towards the core sector as I always wanted to make my career in a field in which interaction with people was more than interaction with machines. I knew that I couldn’t sit in front of a PC for 4 to 5 hours and do coding. One plus point of Civil Engineering is that in the core sector, candidates have both options, either you can go to the private sector or to a government job. In the private sector, the work pressure will be a bit higher but at the same time, there will be more learning opportunities. While working in the private sector you will feel like an entrepreneur after a few years of experience as you will be handling multi-crore projects equivalent to the size of small-cap companies. It is a high-risk job where a single small mistake can cost you lacs of rupees, and therefore, the remuneration will be high too. As a fresher in this industry having zero experience and zero risk handling capacity you will be paid low initially but, with experience, you can achieve exponential career growth. If you see the government sector then UPSC (ESE) is the best achievable option. It gives you techno-managerial job opportunities as well as social privileges. Work pressure is a little less in comparison to the private sector. Considering all these factors, I started preparing for UPSC(ESE), a competitive exam conducted by UPSC for recruitment of candidates in various engineering positions in government departments. Accordingly, I did my compulsory internship in a PSU only. In my third year, I was wholeheartedly preparing for the ESE/GATE exam and I was not targeting on-campus placements, but in late November and early December, I feared to miss out on any available Opportunities during the campus placements. I was in a great dilemma as my main exam was in early January only and I knew that the placement phase is very turbulent and could harm my preparation for the exam, but I finally decided to put in efforts for the core companies visiting the campus.'),

I remember my interview took place through a VC and they cross-checked my answer on the internet about the earthquake zone of the location told by me. Practical questions from the internship experience were asked. Basic questions from the Course ‘RC structures’ like Why should we do curing?, 7-day strength percentage?, What does M20 Mean? Etc. were some of the questions that they asked. They were expecting full definition type answers from me. Never forget to revise EIA if you have mentioned in your resume.

(907, 25, 'Message for Junta', 'Would you like to say something to the general KGP junta out there? And perhaps give them a message?', 'I would only like to say that, explore your interest while you are in KGP but at the same time be cautious and avoid wasting time in the name of exploring. Make friends, learn technical skills and be positive all the time. Baki toh KGP ka tempo high rehta hi hai.'),
(916, 5, 'Introduction', 'Hello Krutarth, this is Pradipti from Communiqué, an I’d like to ask you a few questions for Communiqué’s initiative, CQ ConsulTalks.', 'Hello Pradipti, sure you may.'),
(917, 5, 'Companies Interviewed For', ' So, my first question is, what were the companies that you interviewed for?', ' There are a few off-campus companies that come for Consulting every year i.e, Parthenon EY, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), McKinsey and LEK Consulting (however, didn’t come the last year.) As far as on-campus placements are concerned, Auctus Advisors is the only company that comes for consulting. I was shortlisted for two companies, BCG and Parthenon EY.'),
(918, 5, 'Nature of Interview Process', 'What was nature of the interview process that you went through for both the companies?', 'The interview process for both the companies ie, BCG and Parthenon EY was almost the same. Firstly, there was a CV Shortlist round, where most companies look for a CGPA of around 8 or above, except for McKinsey which looks for a CGPA of 8.5 or above, I myself had a CG of 8.33 and therefore, I wasn’t shortlisted for McKinsey. Next, is a series of 3–4 telephonic interviews that you have to attend, followed by another round of shortlisting when you will be called to either Mumbai or Kolkata by the company for further rounds of interview. There another 4 interviews take place and after that, the results come out.'),
(919, 5, 'Kind of questions', ' Could you please tell me about the kind of questions that were asked in the interview in various rounds? And how to prepare for these interviews?', 'All of these interviews were case interviews, where you basically had to solve a case. I think most people are aware of case interviews which need proper case preparation i.e, forming a group of four people, where one has to act as an interviewer and the others will act as interviewees and you need to practice cases. This is a very standard procedure that everyone has to follow. To prepare for Case interviews, there are two sets of books, and there are other seniors like myself, who can help and guide you; it is essential that you keep practising between different groups because the number of cases for practise are limited. There is also a Consult Case Prep FaceBook group which interested students can join to prepare better. There is also a drive link that has been shared on the group, which contains all the materials for the preparation of various number of cases. Also, it is important to start forming case groups in the summer itself and start the preparation with them right after coming to the campus, as there is only one or around one-and-a-half month before the companies start arriving at the campus, so there is not enough time for preparation.'),
(920, 5, 'Frequently asked Questions', 'What are the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think that students should definitely prepare for? Especially for HR rounds', 'Other questions apart from Case Questions are HR questions and your CV only. They can ask you questions about your CV, like the PORs you have, or the projects/interns you’ve mentioned. So, you should be able to answer them. HR questions are mostly the standard questions, and nothing very different for Consult.'),
(921, 5, 'Advice for upcoming placement season', 'What are the things students sitting for placements next year can do from now to December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector?', ' Usually, for Consult, the placements do not go on till December. They are done by the month of September-October. And so, preparation should be started early, preferably in the summers itself, and case groups should be formed. Also, make sure your CV and cover-letter are strong and get them reviewed by various seniors to keep them updated.'),
(922, 5, 'Preparation after shortlist', 'How did your preparation for technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted?', 'Matter-of-fact, there were no technical rounds, there were surely some calculative type cases but, there is nothing technical that comes in a consulting interview. So, there is no technical preparation required.'),
(923, 5, 'General advice and funda', 'Anything else that you would like to tell/share with the students?', 'In general, all of us people at the consulting companies, we were planning to form a group to help out people interested in consulting, so, if you could make a database of people, we could do so, and help out people directly.'),
(924, 20, 'Introduction', 'Hello everyone, today we have Kavita Priyadarshini who has been placed at Razorpay. So we are here to interview her regarding her preparations and strategies to crack the interview of this company. So firstly could you explain to us about the field of ‘Product Management’?', 'Hello everyone. Basically, as a product manager, one has to work with the Business, Technical and the User Experience functions and look into identifying the needs of the customer, the end-to-end process of ideation and development of product solutions that cater to those needs and finally making sure that the product reaches the customer.'),
(925, 20, 'Interview process', 'Ok Kavita. Now as we have grabbed the basics of this field, could you describe the general interview process for your company?', 'First, there was a deck submission for which a problem statement(PS) was given and we got a window of 10–15 days to prepare it. Based on the deck, shortlisting was done. After that, we had our Campus interviews. There were 3 rounds. These rounds were related to Problem Solving, Product Thinking and Technical Understanding Cases.'),
(926, 20, 'Description of first round', 'Thanks Kavita for explaining about the general interview process. Could you please tell us about the first round?', 'In the first round, we had problem-solving and product-thinking cases. In Problem Solving Cases, we have to find hidden problems and their solutions for a given product. For example the usage of an app has gone down by 10%, why? In Product Thinking Cases, we have to come up with creative product solutions. For example design Netflix for kids. To prepare for these, one can go through books like Cracking the PM Interview and Preparing for Product Interviews by IIT Madras. StellarPeers is also a good platform for this. You must also form a case group along with people sharing similar interests and solve cases together.'),
(927, 20, 'Description of second round', 'That would be really helpful. Now can you tell us about the second round?', 'The second round was regarding technical understanding or products. I was asked questions about a popular app and how it worked from a backend point-of-view. Also, I had to list the technical elements that are at play to ensure that the app runs smoothly. I was also asked to describe how the algorithm of the app works and if I have to build a similar app, what are the technical elements and backend process flow I would incorporate. There were more such situational tech-questions and I was asked to describe some technical terms too. For this, one can refer to the book Swipe to Unlock and go through tech blogs of product-based companies.'),
(928, 20, 'Is coding knowledge needed?', 'So Kavita, is coding knowledge required for this field or an overview is enough?', 'It’s better to have some coding knowledge since a PM has to interact a lot with the technical team. But you’re not expected to actually code, you just need to know the basics of how things work.'),
(929, 20, 'Description of third round', 'Very well, then it’d be quite a nice alternative for all students who don’t like to code. Can you just enlighten us more about the third round?', 'In the third round, I was asked questions related to problem-solving strategies such as defining users for a particular app, determining KPIs to measure a particular parameter under certain constraints etc. Then the interviewer asked some questions regarding the field of product management, like “Why do you want to be a product manager?”,“Why are you the ideal candidate for this role?”,“Tell me about the time when you led a team” etc. It was more like a mentor to mentee discussion and he asked me if I had any questions too. I discussed with him the scope of this role at large.'),
(930, 20, 'Preparing for consulting also', 'I would like to clear one query that is, is it possible to have the preparation for both Consulting and Product Management?', 'Yes, it is possible to prepare for both. In fact, sometimes, we used to solve Consult cases from Case Interviews Cracked by IIT Bombay and DayOne by IIT Madras. It really helps in broadening the perspective.'),
(931, 20, 'Importance of POR', 'Thank you Kavita for the insights. Does having a POR help in the shortlisting of the candidates?', 'I think if you have worked in a team, it really enhances your leadership skills and personality as a team player and that shows in the selection process.'),
(932, 20, 'From when to prepare', 'I would like to ask, is it necessary to prepare for this field right from the first or second year?', 'For the first or second-year students, it is too early to prepare for any specific field and focus solely on placements. It is better to explore as much as possible and get a good understanding of the various areas that seem interesting and then make an informed decision for the future.'),
(933, 20, 'Message for Junta', 'Surely, your advice will be really valuable for all of us. So, I think I have reached the end of my questions. So, is there any message you want to give to your juniors in KGP?', 'I would like to emphasise that the campus really has a lot to offer in every direction and the best way is to explore and learn along with your batchmates. That way the learning process becomes much more enjoyable. The seniors in KGP are the best resources and they are extremely approachable, they can guide you about what is right and what is not. Keep doing something, anything! Just don’t let the most beautiful years of your life go in vain. Make the most of it! All the best!'),
(946, 23, 'Why core..?', 'What was the general interview process for the companies that you aimed for? Also, how did you decide to go in the core profile?', 'One of the reasons why I chose core Mechanical Engineering is by the time I completed my 3rd year and I was ready for placements. I had a research internship in the core field, I had a few involvements with research groups in the core field and I felt that I have expertise in that field. So I think it is a very important decision to take because thinking a bit ahead in your career and kind of being in a field in which you are trained in or you’re an expert in or feeling like you have the highest potential in, will actually give you a kind of inner motivation. So I think one of the pros of choosing the core field is that you already have a lot of experience in fact and you already have prior expertise in that. But of course, it is true that the opportunities in the core field are a bit less. Although not less but they are not that rewarding in the first few phases as compared to other fields so kind of builds up an intuition that core fields are tough but I would like to say that there are a lot of companies which give adequate remuneration if you consider the kind of growth opportunities you have and one of the most timely argument that I would like to give to anybody to fix the issue between core and non-core fields is to first realise where your expertise is. Like you may feel that you’re a good manager and have a lot more managerial skills. Then I think the next question should be what are the core properties I want to build? Like you could be a good manager but how? What do you think you’re a good manager at? Are you good at managing designs? Are you good at taking design decisions? Are you good at taking innovative decisions? So that is how I think. A lot of whys’ need to be asked before deciding which field to choose and in my personal case, like on Day 1 of placements I had actually 3 companies in my mind. The first one was Sony, Japan which had a profile in Robotics, the next was ITC which was mostly managerial but as far as I can say it was mostly on Operations Management and third was Jaguar and Land Rover which was about automotive design and stuff. So I first decided what are my core competencies and I realized I have a lot of experience in automobile design and robotics of course. So that is how I started out so realizing where your expertise lies will actually help you in deciding your profile and which companies you want to go for. Also, before you go for companies and stuff you need to sit down and ask yourself a why question which is like suppose I want to go for consulting so my first question would be why? So I should list out a few factors like maybe I’m good at coming to innovative decisions, or maybe I’m good at seeing things from a broader perspective which is good for consulting or maybe that yeah I love a job which helps me in travelling. So after you have those things settled out you have to again ask yourself a why question like why am I good at innovation so you could know that ok well I can connect dots before people can and so on and finally why do you want a job that gives you the scope to experiment at various places and you think that you love innovating. So I think it boils these questions down to find a core pattern of your expertise and from that I think you should choose the company you want to go for.');

(947, 23, 'Importance of cgpa', 'Also, many of us have heard that for going into the core sector your CG should be high and then only you should aim for the core. So would you like to comment on that statement?', 'I think when you’re applying in core then there is something that I call as the Goldilocks zone for CG at end of 8th semester which for Mechanical is roughly around like I think if you have a 9+ CG it could but the interviewer in dilemma whether to take you or not because at 9.1 or 9.2 CG you can get into foreign universities and recruiters do not want to recruit you if you want to go for higher studies. So the Goldiloc’s Zone for CG is mostly around 8.5 to 9.1. And if you’re above 9, then the basic question you need to answer is why don’t you want to go for higher studies? So that is a question you always have in the back of your mind when you go with a high CG. If you’re below 8.5 or 8.6 then the question that comes to you is that what is the reason you have a low CG? So there the question actually falls in 2 places — the first one is you can say that I’m good in the core field, but some other subjects like Biology and Economics which I was kind of forced to take as a part of the curriculum are the reason, and the other thing is that you can always balance your CG with a mix of your aptitude. Like your work experience aptitude. And how that works is like you can say that I have worked in fields which required me to work on knowledge that is not much covered in my curriculum like e.g. you can say that I’m good in power systems and power systems are not covered in mechanical curriculum. So I think there’s always a place for rational decision on this part but the point is that you need to clear it for the interview round and for that if your CG is below 8.5 then it will be most good for you to do well in the pre-interview tests. That is where I think some of your focus should go to if your CG is between 8.5–9.1'),
(948, 23, 'Interview process', 'Okay so my next question is what was the general interview process for the companies you aimed for?', 'In most of the companies I went for there were mostly 1 or 2 rounds of interviews. In JLR there were 2 rounds but I had to do only 1, I think I was fortunate in that part. In most of the interviews there were actually 3 parts. So the first part is where they ask you general process about mechanical engineering and in this part for some companies like ITC and somewhat in Bajaj Auto also that give you an option to choose your preferred subject and in others like JLR and Sony, Japan they come out with their own questionnaire to maintain uniformity across students. But whatever be the case you should always be ready for answering the questions out of you comfort zone also and in your comfort zone you should be able to answer questions which involve critical thinking. Another important thing in this part is most of the questions are actually related to practical applications such as what is the loading pattern? How do you pull that? So I think it is important for anybody who’s interested to prepare for questions on practical applications and critical thinking and this can be thoroughly developed through hands-on experience either via research groups, projects or internships. Next part of the interview is the CV round. In this round they run through your CV for what you’ve done. They try to find out what you have obtained from the work you did and they often ask you how you can replicate that experience in the scenario that they have set up for themselves. So for example I was working at University of Tokyo on Intelligent Vehicle Systems and they asked me that if Jaguar Land Rover wants to launch an intelligent vehicle then what is your role as a mechanical engineer in supporting that. So that I think is the exercise we need to do. So go through the details of the job you’re appearing for and how your past experience is linked to it. And the third and the final round is what people call the HR round and in my case, JLR asked me guesstimate questions, they asked me questions about how I manage teams and how I work with teams and what’s my overview on project management. I believe it isn’t something that can be built in a day but of course you can go through a lot of management books and other books you have interest in and that gives a fair idea of what you need to do. At the end of the day I think being able to find out things from your experience which relates to that question is all that you need to do.'),
(949, 23, 'Resources', 'Any resources you’d like to mention which you used while your preparation? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc.', 'So I was involved in various places and hence I learned a lot from there. But I think uniformly you need to revisit everything you’ve mentioned in your CV and you should know what you’re speaking of. Apart from that, for core I think you should go through a book that details out everything important which is just for the review before the interview to revise all the concepts. For the placement session it is important to give yourself a complete exposure to quantitative reasoning problems. At the back of your mind your analytical reasoning capacity should be good. And also if you’re in touch with those things then it’s easier for you to come up with a solution and also most of the people will also be open for the consulting profile so there are some mathematical models that you can use. Also, it is useful to have concise notes of the subject matter for a revision before the interview. Particularly for JLR, question sets from Gate entrance are a good resource for core mechanical engg. practice. Months before the placement session is it important to have daily practice of coding and reasoning question sets, these are crucial parts of the pre-interview tests. In this regard, having a peer group helps to remain focussed and derive motivation. Please avail test series if possible. Apart from all this some overview on guess-estimates and mathematical models will help.'),
(950, 23, 'Preparation strategy', 'So my next question to you is about your strategy of preparation. Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'For every company there is actually a kind of mindset which they come for like when you’re sitting for something like ITC we should be aware they are very much focused on your analytical ability. Which is like they want from you to solve problems that other people in your place cannot solve. However in JLR, when you need to provide them is that you’re an integral part of the team and you can work wherever it’s required and you have a decent exposure to the work. But in places like Sony, Japan what they want from you is that you should have a prior experience in your work area. So for every company you need to know what is it’s type of interview, you need to find out from people what is the kind of preparation that you need to do and you need to change your strategy, of course. You need to have a predefined strategy for each company.'),
(951, 23, 'Message for the Junta', 'That’s quite useful advice. So my last question to you is if you’d like to say something to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them?', 'Yeah, so I think a lot of people want to go into core sectors. Also one of the most lucrative options of the core sectors is that you can work on your expertise and that what is more important for you is to know what you want to play out in these parts of your life. So it’s basically like seeing this resource in a broader perspective and being very focused on it. So you need to know what it is that you want to take after being at a company. Do you want to be in that job for 5–10 years? Or you want to be in management so you want to take off a little bit of time to go ahead. So that will give you a very clear idea about what kind of companies and what kind of field you want to go for. That I think is another important thing while choosing the company. So I think in the whole placement process, choosing your company is as much as being there in the interview because what it does is in the interview process it takes away much of your load off as you then have a lot of information which empowers you to go there and deliver almost everything that you know. So then you have a lot less surprises in the interview and you can actually give your best.'),
(966, 24, 'Why core..?', 'How did you decide to go in the core profile considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about?', 'I was genuinely interested in naval architecture from my first year itself. I did my internship in the core area in my 3rd year. I also did some research work in this field. So, it’s basically my subject of interest and hence I went for it.'),
(967, 24, 'Interview process', 'What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for?', 'The first selection was CV based. Then there was a written test. 60 questions are from discipline subject having difficulty level similar to GATE Exam. And rest 25 questions are based on reasoning, data interpretation, and some numerical questions. Around 60% was the qualifying criteria for the next round. There was no GD but a direct round table PI. There were no separate technical or HR rounds. 9 people from the administrative side of the company comprising of HR and tech persons asked questions from different segments. They selected in the ratio of 1:5 i.e. 1 out of 5 people from one round of PI.'),
(968, 24, 'Importance of cgpa', 'Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement?', 'Well it doesn’t depend on CGPA totally. If your resume is very good, then you can get a relaxation in CGPA. A good CGPA is a plus point. POR is important in the resume. I was the Hall President of Radhakrishnan Hall of Residence and hence it was a plus point for me. Actually PSUs also prefer students who are hardworking as well as research-oriented. My internship in the Indian Register of Shipping, Bombay was research-based and hence provided an edge over others.'),
(969, 24, 'Resources', 'Any resources you’d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc.', 'For core, you don’t need to take additional courses. Whatever the professors taught was quite enough. In naval architecture, Hydrostatics and Stability and Marine Design are very important. So if you follow the course curriculum with interest then it’s enough for the preparation. I made a LPG carrier ship model and the interviewers were quite interested in that. So such small projects were very effective in such interviews.'),
(970, 24, 'Preparation strategy', 'What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'Basically I was aiming for two core companies only. And I had the same preparation for both of them. One day before the interview, I just researched a bit about the company. Other than this, everything was the same.'),
(971, 24, 'Advice for placements', 'What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year?', 'For placements in such companies, I would tell the juniors to give their interview with full enthusiasm. Try to answer the questions in a bit funny way. I did hall dramatics and they asked me to enact a small role from a play. So if you are interactive and answer the questions with humor then they will definitely take you as a unique person and increase your chances of getting selected.'),
(972, 24, 'Message for Junta', 'What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them?', 'If you are interested in coding or core, do pursue your interest. And be interactive with everyone. All of the candidates who are sitting for placements are your batchmates only and try to boost each other’s morale and confidence. 5'),

(989, 58, 'Why Core..?', 'How did you decide to go in the core profile, considering that coding and data are the most discussed?', 'The answer to your question; I did prepare for the coding interview, mostly algorithms part, but most of my seniors and friends were into core profiles, so I didn’t prefer coding. My profile included coding in core profiles. So I had prepared for both of them.'),
(990, 58, 'Interview process', 'What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for?', 'I mainly aimed for core profiles only, especially the embedded core electronics profiles. I was shortlisted for two companies; Enphase Solar Energy PVT LTD and Western Digital. Western Digital had the prerequisite of a CGPA above 7.5 to appear for their exam. They considered our performance in their exam interview only. They verified all that was relevant in my CV in the interview itself. I had completed an online course on Verilog, which is very useful for embedded core electronics, especially for FPGA and IC designing. They had asked me questions regarding this as it was relevant to their company. On the other hand, Enphase focused more on the CV. I went through four rounds for Western Digital, where they ask basic digital electronics questions. For this, you should be thorough with the things taught in your courses and Verilog coding. The second round was the Analog profiles, where I was asked questions taught in class, and also, you should be updated on the new technologies in Analog. Reading some research papers would do good. The third round was with the Director, where they asked some HR questions and some theory questions. Here they verified all that was mentioned on your CV. The final round was the HR round. In Enphase, I got shortlisted for an embedded core electronics profile. I had two rounds of interviews. The first one was software-based, and the second one was based on core electronics and HR round. In the first round, they asked questions on the much-talked topic; the Internet of Things.'),
(991, 58, 'Importance of cgpa', 'Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement?', 'The cutoff for core profiles is very high, around 8–8.5. Some companies like Nvidia have their cutoff above 9. So to qualify for their written exams, you need a high CGPA. The most important thing for core profiles is that you must be thorough with all your concepts. The questions asked are very similar to the ones asked in college vivas. A CGPA of about above eight is considered good enough.'),
(992, 58, 'Resources', 'Any resources you’d like to mention which you used while preparing? E.g.- any additional subjects you took, online courses, books etc.', 'It is highly recommended to do some additional work apart from your course. For example, we have two courses; Analog electronics and digital electronics. Apart from that, I advise students to take up the course in semiconductor physics for the second year and the course for VLSI engineering in the third year in the EC department. Usually, students from the electrical engineering department won’t have these courses, but I advise them to take these courses as additionals or electives. One more course by Professor Ashish Maity called Analog Signal Processing in the autumn semester and Mixed-Signal Processing in the spring semester. The topics discussed in these courses are directly related to the placement interviews. There is another course called SMPC, which is for power electronics profile that could prove very helpful.'),
(993, 58, 'Strategy of preparation', 'What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'Yes, the profiles are completely different, so we have to change our strategy for preparation. For Western Digital, I revised Verilog from the online course I did and for Enphase power electronic notes. As I mentioned earlier, you also need to be updated with the latest technologies. So for that, you can follow the companies on LinkedIn or browse the companies webpages. Companies update their feed with their latest technologies. Like if you subscribe to Texas Instruments, you’ll receive mail from them informing you about the latest technologies regularly. Referring to a research paper is optional, but subscribing to such companies would provide you with a good source if you wish to do so.'),
(994, 58, 'Opportunities in core', 'It is generally said that there are fewer opportunities in the core sector than non-core sector. Is this the case, and is if so, what are the options we should look out for and focus on?', 'Opportunities in core profiles are indeed minimal. I did my internships in software profile with Samsung. So I advise not to rely entirely on core profiles but also prepare for software profiles too. In software, knowledge about data structures and algorithms would be enough. This helps you in case you don’t get placed in a core profile. It would help if you also kept in touch with your seniors so that you are also able to apply off-campus.'),
(995, 58, 'Advice for placements', 'What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year?', 'The only advice I would give is that be thorough with whatever your professors teach you. I have observed a lot of the juniors to be worried about placements. I would tell them that there are a lot of opportunities ahead. Even if you don’t get placed in campus interviews, you can always apply for off-campus ones, appear for the GATE exam, etc. You focus on what you need to do right now, and you’ll get what you wish for.'),
(996, 58, 'Message for Junta', 'What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them?', 'For the time being, they should take care of themselves from COVID. Also, keep improving your interpersonal skills by engaging in hall activities. For getting experience, contact a professor and take up a project under them. You have to mail the professors and talk to them to take up a project. And there are no criteria whatsoever for taking up a project. Professors do not consider your CGPA to give you an assignment. You have to keep your concepts clear to complete the project. This would give you a significant advantage as you’ll learn a lot in these activities. There will be many people learning data and programming around you, but I never really took much interest in it. I took up a project under a professor at the starting of the third year and learned everything from there.'),

(998, 59, 'Why Core..?', 'How did you decide to go in the core profile, considering that coding and data are usually most discussed?', 'It was something that was built upon from my first year itself. In the first year, I was involved in Robotics, and in my second year, I got involved in a research group called Aerial Robotics, where I was a hardware team member. That’s where the initial foundation began. Then in my first year, the winter workshop is where I got the knack for hardware robotics. I figured that the implementation of concepts was more appealing to me than anything theoretical. So, then in our research group, we worked on designing stuff and making the hardware more reliable. So that’s where it eventually started, and after that, in my third year, I tried to pursue coding and data sciences as everybody was doing at the time, but something about that didn’t resonate with me. I tried picking them again a couple of times after that, but I decided that it’s not for me pretty soon. After which, I got more and more involved in robotics. Then I tried to get an internship in Canada through various programs like UARE, MITACS etc. That was usually your best shot at a respected university. Fortunately, that year, many of the students from IIT Kharagpur were selected for the internship; I was one of them. The project there was also very much related to what I had already worked in, which immensely helped build my profile. That was pretty much where I got my experience and the internship and played an essential part in the interview, in the test that I gave and finally in placement that I got.'),
(999, 59, 'Interview process', 'So, now that we have known all about how interesting these fields can be, even though they say Coding and Data Analytics are the best fields. Can you elaborate on the general interview process, round by round?', 'Lam Research offered two core profiles: mechanical and electrical Firstly, they took a pen and paper test where they gave you 10 or so theoretical questions. As far as I can recall, they were not too difficult, but on the basic concepts that you study during your second and third year like heat transfer, fluid mechanics, a combination of those. A few questions from mechanics that we learn in the first year and mechanics of solids were combined in 10 questions. I’d rate them as easy to moderate level. Even when it was online, you had to solve each question on a piece of paper, take a photograph of it, make a pdf of it, and upload it on the given platform. That was the only test for shortlisting. After that, I think about 10–15 people were shortlisted for both profiles.'),
(1000, 59, 'Description of further rounds', 'Thank you for elaborating about the first round in such great detail. I must say our readers will get a lot of insight from this. Now can you please talk about the next rounds?', 'Next, the shortlist was released and then in the early morning, the first interview started, and it went on for around 1 hour for each candidate where they looked into your resume, they asked you about the best project which you could describe, and the resume dictated that interview. They went in-depth on every project or project that they found relevant to the field you said you were interested in. They dug deeper into it, and they asked you theoretical questions and conceptual questions linked to your project. After they took the first round, the shortlisted people faced the next round of interview wherein it was an aggregate of the HR and tech combined. Here they asked about things like if you want to go for higher education and all. They wanted to test if we were fit for their industry. So they asked me a bunch of HR questions (Like if you could change anything in your past, what would it be?) and technical questions similar to the first interview, and that was it. There were no further rounds after that (The first was purely technical, and the second was an aggregate of HR and technical).'),
(1001, 59, 'Importance of cgpa', 'So, I guess we have, in-depth, gone through all of the rounds, so now let us move to one common question, which is always asked. Many of us have heard that if we are going for a core Sector, our CGPA should be very high. Would you like to comment on that?', 'I want to say that, yes, CGPA plays a vital role, I cannot emphasize that enough, but an essential aspect of getting through your interviews are the projects and actual practical knowledge of things. So, in my case, I didn’t have a very high CGPA, but I had involvement in Research groups, Robotics and I had done a foreign internship, along with certain substantial PORs. So, even if you do not have the CGPA, you need to have the other things that balance out the difference between you and the other candidates. You need to have the knowledge and a good experience on projects. The only thing that matters more than your GPA is your ability to convince the interviewers about your other skills, knowledge, and expertise.'),
(1002, 59, 'Experience or cgpa?', 'So, would you advise that we should place experience higher than the CGPA?', 'I am saying that there should be a good balance between both. And even if you feel that your CGPA is not good enough for going to such companies, you can always have good sufficient work experience and practical knowledge of how things work to crack it. Both items are equally important, but you need to have the other aspect equally strong if you do not have one thing. Finally, the fact remains that things become much simpler when you have a decent CGPA, so you should work for that. And in case you feel that theoretical work doesn’t excite you much, you can always pick up projects to learn their practical aspects. Both of the things will take you a long way if you work hard.'),
(1003, 59, 'Resources', 'That was quite insightful. So, our next question is that there are many resources we use while preparing, so would you like to mention some of the sources you used during preparation, online courses, books, or anything else?', 'So, not particularly for this, because I just prepared my CV, given that’s the main thing that guides the interview flow. So, I would say that you should study the core technical courses like Fluid Mechanics, Mechanics of solids and stuff, you know things like that. People usually try to dig deep into subjects thinking the questions will be very hard. But in my experience, that’s not true. I’ve figured that the in-depth knowledge in such things is often not very useful, because they ask you basics only. And that’s where you need to be good at. Not just knowing it in theory but knowing why are they implemented. So, you need to be aware of all the basic formulas, conceptual learnings and a little practical knowledge. You need not dig too much deeper into these topics, but you need to have a good conceptual understanding of the main subjects.'),
(1004, 59, 'Important topics', 'So, you said, we should be paying attention to the core subjects like Fluid Mechanics, Mechanics and Solids. Could you mention, apart from these, some important topics?', 'So, heat transfer was an important topic for most of the questions they asked because my project was related to it somehow. So, there is no hard-bound set of rules that you need to follow like, this is the subject they will exactly ask from. They can ask anything. It would help if you were well versed with the topics involved in your project; for example, your project involves fluid mechanics or mechanics and solids. You only need to be aware of the basic concept and some in-depth concepts in such topics.'),
(1005, 59, 'Preparation strategy', 'So, I would like to ask what was your preparation strategy? So, like when the first round was over, did you change your preparation strategy? Or Did you change your preparation strategy for different companies?', 'Yes, of course, the core sector was not the only one that I was trying for. I tried to go for management consultancy for other companies that appeared like American Express and got shortlisted in some of them. Unfortunately, the major companies that I was aiming for, like ITC and P&G, didn’t come this year, so I had to work with what I had. If you talk about change in strategy for Round 1 and round 2, there wasn’t much. Since it was the same company, there was a change of plan between different companies, like for a core company, you have to give the CV where you have highlighted your projects. For management roles, you need a CV where your POR’s are stressed.'),
(1006, 59, 'Importance of POR', 'Oh, ok, one more question: Does POR play a part in the internships in the core sector or is it the research work?', 'Definitely, the ‘Research Work’ plays a significant role. I wouldn’t say that there wasn’t any role of PORs because when you have a POR it’s not just the certificate that matters but the experience you have with it. Your confidence to show up in an interview and your confidence to tackle the questions you don’t know how to answer is where your POR helps you. If you have a POR, it does not matter in terms of the certificate. Still, in terms of your overall experience to tackle difficult situations, I’d say it can make a significant difference. But if you are talking strictly about what helps you during the interview, that’s the research project you have done throughout your college and nothing else.'),
(1007, 59, 'Opportunities in core sector', 'So, coming to the next question, what are the opportunities in the core sector you have got this year?', 'So, from the placement point of view, the opportunities in the core sector are minimal, not talking about the circuital cluster not CS, CC, Electrical, they get their ample opportunities in term of their core sectors, but when it comes to mechanical, civil, ocean engineering and naval architecture, biotech, the companies that visit are pretty limited. If you go further down, like for Metallurgy students, their opportunities decrease, and even the pay scale is not on par. People usually say that there are still well-paying jobs for you if you do a good amount of coding or data sciences. From what I experienced, if 90 per cent of jobs require data and coding, there are only ten jobs that would require core skills. I’d say that it is still moderately better than other departments in mechanical, but overall, the non-circuit core sectors have much fewer opportunities than their coding and data counterparts.'),
(1008, 59, 'Advice for placements', 'One last question would be, what advice would you like to give to your juniors who would be sitting for placement this year?', 'I already answered this question before in the question where you asked if CGPA is essential. So, people usually give up if their CGPA is like, say, 7.5 or 7, believing that the core field is not made for them, even if they have somewhat of an inclination towards it. Often the theoretical side of things doesn’t make too much sense, and that’s where you start to lose interest. Still, having a practical knowledge of things, going out there and participating in competitions, attending workshops, and joining research groups can change your view towards the core field. That’s what exactly happened with me, and eventually, things fell into place, I got a good amount of exposure to different experiences. But since I have been through this, I can tell you for a fact that if you are willing to do it despite the CGPA, you can make it into the core fields, but hard work in this equation remains irreplaceable. So if you are not earning your CGPA, it needs to be substituted with practical knowledge. Also, you can feel free to contact me on any platform if you need some further advice on building your core profile.'),
(1009, 59, 'Message for Junta', 'Thanks a lot Akshay for such insightful advice. At last, would you like to say anything to the general KGP junta out there, any advice for them, the first and the second years?', 'It’s been a tough year for all of us, you know. All of us are just sitting at our homes, hoping for things to get better, and I hope they will. And I cannot express this enough, but once you are in KGP, I would want you to try n-number of things that widen your horizon of the things you can learn and not just take you in a single direction. I wouldn’t tell you to go and try everything, but don’t shy away from different kinds of experiences and get out of your comfort zones. Don’t go saying ‘yaar ye to nahin ho payega’ or ‘Kafi mushkil hai ye’. Do not look at the status that these people are the only ones that get there. If you want to do something, just go for it and make sure that there are no regrets. And yeah, all the best for your future :)'),
(1034, 9, 'Career in Consulting', 'INTERVIEWER: How did you decide that you have to aim for a consultancy profile?', 'BINDU: I believe that why consulting is the first question one should ask before delving into the preparations. The answer is subjective to people but I would like to walk you through my decision-making process. Throughout my KGP journey, I decided to explore various sectors through my internships and engagements, I had done research internships, and corporate internships in the core and non-core sectors. Also in the institute front, I was involved in several managerial positions. After exploring all those sectors I realized that one thing which I really enjoyed was client interactions and problem-solving. Besides that, I participated in several case studies which brought clarity in my mind regarding career choices. So, consulting became a natural choice for me.'),
(1035, 9, 'Pros and Cons', 'INTERVIEWER: While deciding were there some pros and cons that you considered?', 'BINDU: Well, that is definitely one important thing to consider. Let me first talk about the pros! I think the one thing which is really important when you choose a career is that it should match the work you really want to pursue. The match with your skill set is also something you need to consider. Secondly, I think the client interaction, the exposure and diversity of problems that comes with the job are a plus point. Now if I talk about the cons, I think one con that is specific to our campus is the number of firms that come for consulting. Last year, 5 firms came to the campus namely Auctus Advisors, BCG, Dalberg, E.Y Parthenon, and Mckinsey. The limited number of firms visiting the campus is a definite con. Apart from that, the consulting firms’ placement process starts before the conventional placement procedure(Dec 1 onwards) which makes everything a bit hectic. So if you don’t get through consulting firms for some reason, then you will face a time crunch to prepare for the December interviews because of the hectic interview process that consulting involves.'),
(1036, 9, 'How to decide?', 'INTERVIEWER: So by what time should a person decide like this is the final decision that this is the profile that I am aiming for?', 'BINDU: The first thing that I’d like to highlight here is that we should not be very particular about a specific career option. Everyone should strategically come up with a plan B in case things don’t add up well. The “if not this, then what?” question should be answered quite early so that there is an ample amount of time for preparation. Since it’s May right now and placements are in December, students should focus on utilizing this time to come up with a proper preparation strategy after boiling down to two particular sectors they want to focus on. It will give them a choice if things don’t work out well.'),
(1037, 9, 'General Interview Process', 'INTERVIEWER: What was the general interview process for the companies you aimed for?', 'BINDU: I only sat for the consulting interview process, so I’ll just walk you through the consulting interview process — chronologically in the way I gave the interview. BCG: Initial CV and CL shortlist Buddy Cases Telephonic Case Interviews(2–3 in number) Final round of interviews at location (3–4 interviews in total) EY-Parthenon: CV/CL shortlist 2. On campus buddy interaction(1 Case interview) 3. 3–4 telephonic/VC case interviews 4. Final round of interviews at location(3 in total) McKinsey: CV/CL shortlist Buddy interaction/cases VC case interviews (4 in total) Dalberg: In Dalberg, the process was a bit different. We had a CV shortlist followed by a 10 minute video call round which consisted of a few fit questions and 2 quantitative questions. The key was to be articulate in explanation and make them understand your motivation behind joining social consulting. Post that the shortlist was reduced significantly and there were 4 subsequent rounds comprising 2 cases each. So 8 cases in total. The cases are social cases and students must make sure they prepare social consulting cases before interviews. One thing to consider is to start your preparation early as the firms came quite early (process started by August) this year.'),
(1038, 9, 'Type of questions', 'INTERVIEWER: In those rounds what type of questions were asked?', 'BINDU: The FAQs are generally common for every consulting interview round. One thing to remember is not to stick to the framework rigidly. In real case interviews, all of the questions are asked from real life cases that interviewers are solving in their particular domain. So, in order to solve those cases, you should always go by first principles of consulting. You should not be very rigid with using frameworks, that rarely works. And you should be holistic in nature while you’re solving the questions. That is one of the tips for every consulting firm. Second is that fit questions should be taken seriously for sure because when you are answering them, a lot of insight about yourself and the knowledge/interest you have for the firm is revealed. So you should really take it into consideration,and in case of consulting firms you should try to keep your HR questions structured because consulting is all about structured problem solving. So when you are answering the HR questions, it should be structured in nature. You should not be answering ‘tell me about yourself’ or some other question all over the place. Apart from that we generally prepare for the questions that will be asked to us but we really don’t focus on the questions that we might need to ask the company. So that is really important, like in the end every company interview ended by ‘if you have any questions to ask?’. So at that time if you ask any generic question, then it creates a bad impression as it’s the last part of the interview and it stays with the interviewer. So you should really try to make that particular question memorable for the interviewer and it should not be a generic question but it should provide insight into your keenness towards the firm.'),
(1039, 9, 'Resources for preparation', 'INTERVIEWER: Can you tell us about what resources you used for preparation? Books or additionals or some online resources', 'BINDU: For consulting I didn’t take any additional subjects. But I used books like Case in Point and Case Interview Secrets that I read during my summer internship only and that cleared the theory and answered what actually consulting is, and also the Victor Cheng videos are a good starter. Victor Cheng videos for case interviews and the book Case Interview Secrets are mostly the same and you can choose any one of them, but the book is more extensive in nature. After that I came back to the campus and started my case preparation by forming a group of people who are really interested and with whom I shared a good bonding. Bonding is very important as the other person in your team should be very honest with you while giving feedback. Hence, you should choose your group wisely- the people you are comfortable with and who are very excited about the process as well. We used standard books like the Day 1.0 and Case Interviews Cracked. After that we shared buddy cases and company interview cases among each other which really helped us. So that is the generic process for consulting. As I mentioned before, we should always have an option B so I also prepared for generic placements.'),
(1040, 9, 'Preparation after shortlist', 'INTERVIEWER: After being shortlisted for successive rounds, did you refer to some new material or change your preparation strategy in between rounds?', 'BINDU: I didn’t have much time as the 1st interview was followed by the 2nd and 3rd & 4th were on the next day for Dalberg. For BCG & EY Parthenon it was entirely on the same day. Hence, I don’t think you should change your strategy or prepare new material as it will not be efficient. Although in between preparing for the companies like Dalberg, I prepared for social sector cases and I looked into what sectors BCG, EY Parthenon and McKinsey worked and tried to prepare or have some knowledge about those sectors. So company specific preparation was there in between interviewing for companies. And obviously we should continue our preparation throughout the process and not halt it once the initial interviews start because it starts really early so it’s not that if one of the rounds of companies is over then you stop your preparation. It doesn’t work like that. Moreover, one should always look back and learn from the mistakes made in previous cases.'),
(1041, 9, 'Advice for juniors', 'INTERVIEWER: What is the advice that you’d like to give to students preparing for consultancy considering the present world scenario', 'BINDU: The one important advice which I’d like to give is that right now we have a lot of time in hand as we’re all mostly staying at home or on campus with no classes as of now and also the academic load due to online classes is relatively low. So I think we should utilise this time to properly and structurally prepare for the interviews. So one might be interested in consulting but obviously s/he will be looking for other options as well. Like in my case I had consulting firms, core firms and generic firms. So we should structure our preparation according to our targeted profiles. If I talk about core companies then that is dependent on the particular department — everyone will have their own way of preparation. For generic preparation I would suggest doing puzzles — many people don’t do puzzles until they are back to campus and that creates a lot of unnecessary chaos. So start doing puzzles, it is very interesting and very helpful as well because most of the companies ask for puzzles and coding questions. For puzzles there are a lot of resources. Quantitative: 1. Heard on The Street 2. 50 Challenging Problems in Probability 3. Geeksforgeeks(Puzzles) 4.Brainsteller 5.Probability Puzzles App 6.Interview bit Coding for generic companies: Interview bit'),

(1043, 7, 'Motivation for Consulting', 'How did you decide that you wanted to go into consulting?', 'I had a lot of 4-year course friends who were already preparing for different profiles be it data science, coding, or finance. So I got a broad idea of different domains. I have been participating in various case challenges and competitions since my second year. That is how I was able to narrow it down to consulting.'),
(1044, 7, 'Previous Internship', 'Did you have any previous internship in this sector?', 'No, not in consulting, but I had some good internships in my core, architecture, that provided me with really diverse work experience and projects that could be justified and talked about in the interviews.'),
(1045, 7, 'Nature of Selection process', 'What was the nature of the interview process you went through for the companies?', 'The interview process for most companies is the same, there is a shortlisting on the basis of CV and cover letter in August or September, then there are 3–4 telephonic round interviews, after which companies like BCG, EY Parthenon and McKinsey schedule their interviews at their offices in Mumbai or Kolkata. Auctus Advisors had a few telephonic rounds after the CV shortlisting and conducted the final interview on the first day of placements. Last year Auctus Advisors was one of the few consulting companies that came to our campus for placements.'),
(1046, 7, 'Questions asked', 'What were the questions you were asked in various rounds and how did you prepare for it?', 'These interviews are mostly based on case interviews, where you are expected to solve a case guided by the interviewer, so it becomes very necessary to practice a lot of cases. Since most of the companies begin the selection process from August or September, it’s highly beneficial to make case groups in the summer and start practising with them soon after reaching the campus because there is hardly a month or two left for selections. It’s good to have a set of motivating people around, who are also interested in the same field. I practised a lot of cases and guesstimates with my case group. There are a lot of resources available to practice cases. You can get started with Victor Cheng’s video lectures series and use different case preparation books by IIT Madras, IIT Bombay and several IIMs to get access to cases for case interview preparation.'),

Are there some things that give one an edge or increase the chances of shortlisting?', 'Consulting placements are usually not like other placements, most of it is finished till October or November. Therefore, it is very important to start preparing from the summers itself like preparing a case group, usually of four. The initial shortlisting is completely based on CV and cover letter, so making a proper CV and getting it rectified by as many good seniors is important. For the initial shortlisting, CGPA plays an essential role. Apart from case preparation, I think PORs, foreign internships, and projects also have an impact on the shortlisting.'),
(1048, 7, 'Frequently Asked Questions', 'What are the FAQs that you think candidates must definitely prepare for, especially in the context of HR round?', 'Some common questions which they ask are- Tell us about yourself? “What’s your story” or “Walk us through your CV”, “What is your motivation to enter the field of consulting?” and questions related to things that are not in your CV, different internship related experiences, and PORs. HR round is something which people generally don’t prepare very well for, and think we can easily answer these basic questions about us and our CV, but they are an equally important part of the interviews as well.'),
(1049, 7, 'Advice for juniors', 'Any advice for the second-year students who are confused about which line to pursue- data, finance, etc?', ' I think trying things out is the only way, it’s better to take part in different competitions, taking up projects so that you can really identify what you would like to pursue.'),
(1050, 8, 'Introduction', ' Interviewer: Hi, everyone! Today we are interviewing Miss Runjhun Bharti Goswami who was recently placed in Auctus Advisors. So, let’s begin the interview.So Runjhun, how did you decide that you wanted to go into consulting?', 'Runjhun: It’s well known that consulting is a good platform to start, because, the learning curve is very steep and you are exposed to a lot of different fields be it finance, government sector jobs, etc. I wanted to start with something like that, that’s why I chose consulting.'),
(1051, 8, 'Previous Internship', 'Interviewer: Did you have any previous internship in this sector?', 'Runjhun: No, I didn’t have any previous intern in this field. It all depends on how you tell the story. I mean in every interview they ask a question like “ tell me about yourself” or “what’s your story?” In that, you are supposed to tell about your major internships and projects and in that only, I included this question stating about my last internship when I was in architecture field but the part I liked the most was about meeting with the consultants, as it was a huge project, and I and liked the brainstorming part, resolves and conflicts.'),
(1052, 8, 'General Interview Process', 'Interviewer: What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed, also please mention the number of rounds, and nature of the interview process?', 'Runjhun: The major four companies that come to our campus are BCG, Mckinsey, EY Parthenon, and L.E.K. They all ask CVs and shortlist in the month of September, and by October everything is wrapped-up. I was shortlisted for BCG, which shortlists around 30 people, who all have a good CV. Then they start further rounds, usually, at least 4 rounds, and can have more depending on what kind of evaluation they want to proceed with. For Auctus Advisors, they shortlisted in October, then they assigned us a buddy, who is usually a person in the second year of the job. They evaluate us on the basis of different categories of cases we have to prepare for. There are mostly two kinds of cases qualitative and quantitative. Quantitative cases are usually covered in the first round of interviews which are usually taken by the buddies. There were three rounds with my buddy, one round with a Manager and one with the Director. Then they shortlisted around 10 people and these people were again interviewed by the Director on the day-1 of placements.'),
(1053, 8, 'Frequently asked questions', 'Interviewer: What were the questions that were asked in various rounds? What were the FAQs that you think students sitting for placements this year must definitely prepare for?', 'Runjhun: The first thing is, there are two books Day 1 and CIC (case interviews cracked) all of the cases from those books are important. The questions depend on the kind of projects the interviewers have worked on. One of the interviewers worked a lot with airlines, so he gave me a case about a new route proposed between two cities. There were several questions from my CV, on the projects that I had done. So it’s necessary that candidates know about the kind of projects the companies are working on. Also, they must be very thorough with their CV.');

They ask you questions like “what is your story?”, your story should come out naturally and must be very grounded and wrapped up within two minutes. I covered my internships and PORs, meanwhile creating a background that though I was pursuing architecture, I was always interested in economics and entrepreneurship. I elaborated on my last intern a little bit, about the work I did and how it drove me into consulting.'),

What people can do is take up good projects, which they can justify and start preparing. They all must start with quant preparation, guesstimates, cases, and puzzles. These are asked frequently and they must be well prepared for that. Also probability, statistics and regression — there are a lot of questions from these in the tests that companies take. I would also suggest forming a case group (usually 4 members). Make a good CV and get it rectified by seniors.'),

(1078, 55, 'Explain Product Management', 'Could you explain to us about the field of ‘Product Management’?', 'Sure! Product management is about learning what users want, your company’s goals related to a product, and translating those thoughts and ideas into product solutions. You do that through a series of creativity and development processes. One way to understand product management is to imagine it as a juxtaposition of user experience, technology and business. Where all these three things meet, I think that’s product management.'),
(1079, 55, 'General Interview Process', 'What was the general interview process for the company you interviewed, and tell us how to prepare for that? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'Generally, there are three rounds of interviews on campus, but these can differ from company to company. Usually, before any rounds of interviews, candidates are shortlisted. You have to make a solution deck based on the company’s problem statement within a specified time frame. Based on the deck and the CV, students get shortlisted for the interview rounds. The idea is during these rounds; you have to answer product and business cases. They might ask guesstimates, product thinking cases, problem-solving cases and strategy questions. There can also be a dedicated round for HR and technical problems. MX Player was the first and only company I interviewed for, and I had to go through 2 rounds of interviews. The first round was about 45 minutes long, and I was asked a guesstimate and some product thinking and solving cases. The whole motive behind this round is to check your logical and structural thinking process. They observe how you respond to questions, process your thoughts and ideas, and reach a solution. The second round was about an hour long. They asked me a mix of product cases as well as HR questions. It ended up with a casual conversation about my CV, and they asked me to elaborate on the relevant experiences mentioned in it. For product management or any managerial role, you need to prepare product and business cases and case studies. Have a good case group to practice cases with and be aware of what’s going on worldwide. It is one of those career paths that are very interesting and complex because you can not learn it academically. It is something that you know with experience, which comes from practice and keeping yourself informed.'),
(1080, 55, 'Is Tech Round Involved', 'One general doubt, is there any technical round involved in the process? And does one need to know how to code for product management roles?', ' Some companies do have a technical round, but it doesn’t involve coding. They judge your technical understanding and general concepts around the technical domain. Coding is not necessary for product management roles because you usually don’t have to code yourself as a Product Manager. But since PMs interact with developers and technical personnel, you need to be aware of the basic concepts and understand their jargon. So, coding is not mandatory, but it’s a plus point if you have that skill set.'),
(1081, 55, 'Questions from different rounds', 'Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical problems, any other discussion in general that you think will prove helpful for students.', 'During the first round, I was asked a guesstimate where they wanted to know how good I was with numbers and if I could structurally convey that information. The interviewer also asked what my favourite product was and how I could improve it. I was also asked to identify the metrics and KPIs to measure the success of an app. They wanted me to solve a problem regarding the decrease of daily active users. In the next round, they grilled me a little on my CV. They asked me questions like “Why do you want to pursue product management”, “Why this company”. They also gave me a few situational questions and asked how I would respond to those conditions. Finally, they gave me a product strategy case to solve. Since there was a lot to discuss during these interviews, I had to keep track of time and answer concisely. It is essential to think out-of-the-box. To do that, stay updated with what is happening around you in the tech, business and product domain. That is the most critical aspect, and it is crucial to remain aware. Because only if you have spent some exploring products and businesses can you form an opinion about them and discuss them comfortably and objectively with the interviewer.'),

Some other examples can be — “Determine the market for iPhone users in India.” or “There has been a 10% decrease in the daily watch time of YouTube, identify the problem and suggest some solutions?”. To prepare for such questions, some resources give us a comprehensive list of such problems and suggest ways to tackle those questions. For example, books like ‘Cracking the PM interviews’, ‘Decode and Conquer’ might be of use. “Swipe to Unlock” is a great book to understand the basics of tech. “Stellarpeers” and “Product management exercises” are good online platforms where you can find popular questions asked during interviews. These are some of the resources that will give you ample practice. For HR questions and specific situation-based questions, you need to be well-versed with your CV, and you should be comfortable answering any questions related to it. Their motive is to catch your interest and passion about the field — whether it’s an informed choice you have made to pursue it or is it just a backup option for you. With rigorous practice, you can become comfortable in handling cases and case studies. You have to keep on practising with your case group because it is not something that you can learn within a short period.'),

Time is of the essence, and you shouldn’t split your efforts too much. If you have already determined that and if you know what you are passionate about, then it’s okay, but if not, you must figure it out as soon as you can. Whether you aim for product management or not, it is essential to practice puzzles and HR questions. As product management is a very competitive field, you must show that you have a genuine interest. Practice puzzles and keep yourselves updated with what’s going on worldwide in the Product and Business space. Find a good set of people with whom you are comfortable, form a case group and start solving cases and guesstimates together.'),
(1084, 55, 'Role of PORs', 'And how far do the positions of responsibility on the campus help you? How has life in KGP has supported you for this role?', 'PORs can help you showcase your team leading and teamwork capabilities for product management roles. If you have good PORs listed in your CV, it can help get you shortlisted for interview rounds. If you don’t have any such experience in your CV, don’t be disheartened since companies give weightage to solution decks for shortlisting. The overall campus experience helped me through the placement process. Whether it’s internships, projects or departmental courses, all this allows you to showcase your skills, no matter how far apart your department is from what you are aiming for. The best part of KGP life is that there are so many opportunities and so much you can learn each day. No matter what you are interested in, you’ll find many chances to explore and develop your skills. So, IITKGP helped me explore and meet good people who helped me throughout this journey.'),
(1085, 55, 'Advices for All', 'Anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'For any pre-final or final year student facing a dilemma, I would suggest staying calm. It is a phase of life, and I am sure that they will do well if they keep faith in themselves and work hard towards what they want. Placement is all about persistence and perseverance; you have to keep putting in efforts even if you think things are not working your way, without worrying too much about the result. It is also an excellent time to stay connected with your friends and learn together. I would suggest you keep working hard and start early. For the first and second-year students, I think college life is essential for exploring as much as possible and try to make the most of all that KGP offers. Don’t be fixated on placements just yet; and instead, focus on exploring your interests and passion. Don’t forget to enjoy your KGP life!'),
(1086, 57, 'How decided to go for Core', 'Hello, Everyone, this is Swarnava Bag. We have Mr. Akhilesh Nalanagula, who has been placed at Cairn Oil and Gas. So, our first question is, how did you decide to go into the core profile? Considering that coding and data analytics are usually most talked about.', 'Actually, when I was in my second year, I got introduced to various subjects related to Earth, and I fell in love with those subjects, and it was then that I decided to go for the core. The scope for the applications of the latest trending topics like Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning in our core sector (for oil and gas explorations) increased my interest in this domain. The fact that there is a bit of coding and such stuff being involved and at the same time getting to know more about Earth got me inclined towards the core sector.'),
(1087, 57, 'general interview process', 'Can you please explain the general interview process for the companies you aimed for from your experience.', 'The only company I applied for was in the oil and gas sector. It came on day one. The interview process consisted of multiple rounds; The CGPA cutoff was 7.5. After that, they shortlisted around 30 students also for the written test. The written test had questions from aptitude and mainly from geophysics and geology. The duration was 1 hour. Then around 21 students were shortlisted again for group discussion. Then finally, about five students were shortlisted for the personal interviews. So these are the primary rounds of the recruitment process.'),
(1088, 57, 'Step by Step Interview Process', 'Thank you, so we now have understood about the general in the interview process. So, now would you like to give a detailed overview step by step?', 'Yeah, sure, these are the steps. There was the CV shortlisting, so all the students who had CGPA above 7.5 were allowed to sit in their written test. It had around 35 questions. 10 out of those were related to aptitude and mental aptitude, which were of primary level and were not complicated. They were straightforward. There were 25 questions, mainly from geophysics and geology. Primarily the questions were from seismic, well logging and structural geology. Then we had a group discussion, which was approximately 30 minutes. The first 20 minutes were for conversation and in the last 10 minutes, we had to give our respective conclusions. The topics were general (e.g. lessons learnt from Corona, E-learning benefits and disadvantages, etc.) After the group discussion, we had a personal interview. There were questions mainly related to previous internships which I had done. There were some technical questions related to my core subjects and few HR questions as well.'),
(1089, 57, 'Importance of High CG', 'Yes, so. I guess you have summed up the entire process in a very detailed manner. So now I have one more question. People generally believe you should maintain a very high CGPA for entering a core field. So is that true? I mean, you already said that it’s 7.5, so is it valid for most of the companies?', 'See, actually cut off lies around 7.5 to 8, so it depends on the company and its policies, and it may change from year to year. The relative performance among fellow batch mates, like if more people are scoring around nine, and if you’re having around eight that may put you in trouble. So I would say that we need to be in the top three to four students of your batch, and that would be a safe zone because there are fewer companies, which makes the competition even more challenging for our core sector. Even if a student is not in the top 3–4 students of the batch (as per CGPA), a firm grip on the fundamentals of core subjects and some internships in the core sector will make that student a strong candidate.'),
(1090, 57, ' resources you used', 'Yeah, so we have completed our most searched question about the CGPA; the next thing is what resources you use to prepare for the companies? Any books or from anywhere?', ' For me, I mainly referred to my class notes. The class notes were very, very useful. Apart from that, I had a couple of books that I will suggest. I will list them down: Seismic: Geldart and Sherrif Gravity, Magnetic: Telford Well logging: Class notes, Paul Grover’s notes.'),
(1091, 57, '', 'So this means following the KGP curriculum was more than enough for your preparation.', ' Yeah, it was enough. If the student is interested, he/she may refer to the different books which I have suggested or as suggested by professors.'),
(1092, 57, 'strategy for preparation', 'And that is all about the preparation resources which we need to follow. And the next thing is, what was the strategy for preparation? Did you Change it in between rounds?', 'Yeah, so um, I prepared for this company stage by stage. For the written test: Class notes and the knowledge acquired over the last four years are sufficient. For Group Discussion: This is a very crucial round for this company. Regardless of the student’s capabilities in the core sector, the officials will filter out the students who do not perform in GDs. So, I prepared for these group discussions from youtube videos mainly. That was sufficient. I would suggest the student prepare his/her opening/conclusion/other relevant templates before the group discussion itself. For personal interview: The questions will be fundamental, and the student is expected to be strong in fundamentals. So, the preparation of 2 months before the interview was sufficient for me. Important subjects were: Seismic, well logging. Gravity, magnetic. I prepared these subjects thoroughly, and also I made sure to revise my past internship works thoroughly as most questions are asked from internships. So, that was my preparation strategy.'),
(1093, 57, 'specific questions should be prepared?', 'Yes, so you said that specific questions should be prepared, from some chapters, so which are those?', 'Yes, so there are a couple of topics which are very, very important. First subject and the most crucial subject: Seismic methods of prospecting (Acquisition and Processing). Other important topics: Well logging, Gravity and magnetic methods. And the topics in which the student has done his/her internships.'),
(1094, 57, ' CV shortlisting most important thing', ' So you said this before. You said that there was a CV shortlisting round. What, according to you, is first the most important thing? Specifically, they would have seen you see the internship or the CGPA or anything else.', 'CGPA is, ofcourse, very important, but at the same time, they look at the internships that the student has done. They prefer students with internships in core companies / even research internships related to the core.'),
(1095, 57, 'other opportunities in the core sector', ' I guess that was Great, so considering that you had gone to the core sector, could you say something about what other opportunities are there in the core sector?', 'Okay, a couple of years ago, like in, 2019 many companies used to recruit students from our campus: ONGC, Schlumberger, Cairn, Exxon Mobil. But post covid, the situation completely changed and this year, only two companies came, which recruited three students from geophysics (including 2 yr MSc courses). So, honestly speaking, there are limited opportunities in the industrial sector, but there are many opportunities in the research sector. Research is a good option if the student is interested.'),
(1096, 57, 'Importance of POR', 'One more thing I would like to ask that in KGP, people are generally given the fundae that POR’s matter a lot. What do you think about it relating to your field?', ' PORs matter but only to some extent. It ultimately comes down to the skills that they are looking for in the student. Having some PORs is a plus point, but even if the student doesn’t have any, it’s okay if he/she is into some king of extracurricular activity (hobby or something).'),
(1097, 57, 'Advice for Juniors', 'OK, I think the next question is what advice would you like to give to your juniors who will be sitting for the placements this year? Anything you would like to feel like to say?', 'So for Geology And Geophysics students, all I would say for those companies is to be fundamentally strong in the core subjects. They should also practice some quantitative aptitude for the tests. They should also keep one backup option ready (coding/data science/ research).'),
(1098, 57, 'Backup Plans should be there?', 'Just one doubt. We should be preparing for the backup thing or the core things, or we should be preparing both Simultaneously.', 'Yeah, both simultaneously should be prepared because the situation gets a bit unpredictable in this core sector and having a backup plan always helps.'),
(1099, 56, 'Why Core', 'How did you decide to go in the core profile considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about?', ' I was preparing for Data science, and apart from that, in my 2nd year and 3rd year, I did two projects under certain professors; that was the only time I was engaged in the core. After that, at the end of 3rd year and in the whole 4th year, I did two internships and prepared for Data science itself. I was preparing for both core as well as non-core. But I didn’t give much time to the core; I gave more time to coding and Data sciences. And to be frank, I was not wholly dedicated to the core. I dedicated more time to data science. I was trying to find a job in Data Science. Hence, if I had not been selected for Airbus, I would have been trying for Fractal Analytics.'),
(1100, 56, 'general interview process', 'What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for?', 'There was one test, and after that, there were two rounds of interviews. The test had some questions of Aptitude, general mathematics, Aerospace itself, a few from marketing and other areas. I think that test was prepared so that anyone can answer a certain number of questions. I believe that the test was not designed to focus on any particular topic. It was like a general aptitude test though I was disappointed to see an irrelevant question for an Aerospace Engineer. But it was clear that it was not designed in such a way to give more priority to some topics. Also, I was applying for other related companies. And my previous internships one was in Computer vision, the other was in Data collection and Data characterization.'),
(1101, 56, 'Importance of CG', 'Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement?', 'Okay, so this particular question’s weight seems too heavy for people with low CG and tend to fear it. I had the same fear. That’s why I was trying for Data Science. But from my experience, I can say that it was not a major point. If you can explain in the right way that why your CG is low, then the interviewers can understand that you are interested in the core but are also parallelly doing stuff other than core. Rather than just thinking about low CG, you have to defend yourself for it. Because we can also understand that if we are going for core means you are reading a subject, your marks are low, then either your aptitude is low, or there is some problem, which means you are not dedicated. So you have to explain that you are doing projects or internships or that you are more into practical stuff than in theory. The CG cut-off for this year was 6. This means the CG cut-off was six but I was not shortlisted in many companies for which I was trying. So, a minimum of 7.5 is necessary as a benchmark.'),
(1102, 56, 'Resources you like to share', 'Any resources you’d like to mention which you used while preparing? E.g.- any additional subjects you took, online courses, books, etc.', 'Yeah, as I have done two projects in my 2nd and 3rd year. So while I was doing the projects, I was wholly dedicated to them. I read quite a lot of research papers related to my projects. If someone puts up any question and I will quickly answer, I know every key point and all the theory related to them. My first project was designing a wing; a group of 4 students tried creating a glider wing. And my 2nd project was the implementation of Tubercles.'),
(1103, 56, 'Your Strategy', 'What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', ' In the core profile, I was aiming for only Airbus, so I used to follow the news, updates about Airbus. Like in my interview, I was asked about the aeroplane Beluga. In the interview, I told more about my projects during my introduction, so they started to ask questions related to them. After that, there were questions posed only about my projects. In the first round of the interview, they asked some questions related to data science as I have done internships related to it. For Data Science, they asked generic things like recall and precision. So for preparation, one should focus on the course itself and some research papers. I was pretty confident about the data science part, so the last few days I spent revising the project going through every point and the concepts related to it, I was recreating my experience of the project itself. Revising in this particular manner, I was able to answer all the questions that they asked. So these are some basic steps that everyone should take, and I took it too. I did not do any external research in the coursework. I just revised what I have already done and took a peep at what the company is currently doing. I asked one of my friends who was also placed in Airbus about the questions that the interviewer asked, but they were completely different. None of the questions matched. But the pattern in which they asked questions was the same. Like my friend has done some work in control, so they asked questions related to control. And I had done my projects in Aerodynamics, so they asked questions from the Aerodynamics, in my interview.'),
(1104, 56, 'Opportunities in Core', 'What are the opportunities in the core sector?', 'Actually, I don’t think there are many options in the core sector, at least in Aerospace. Because ISRO opens for Electrical, Mechanical, and other branches but not for Aerospace, Airbus is the only company we can try. There is also DHL, but I don’t think they are actively recruiting. So Airbus is the only option as Boeing is not coming too. Generally, there are nine profiles in Aerospace one can opt for, but there is not much opportunity. Many people are going for MS, but I was not interested in research, so I don’t know much about it. Not in India, but in foreign countries, there are vast opportunities in research for Aerospace Engineering.'),
(1105, 56, 'Advice for Juniors', 'What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year?', 'From my experience, my advice will be if you have less time and are trying for both things, then understand entirely and revise the work you have done. And be careful about the part where they ask you to introduce yourself because that is where you can direct them to ask any question you want. These are the things that I had learned from my experience of my internships interviews. Focussing too much on the things which you do not know shouldn’t be done. Just be thorough with what you know and do it perfectly. It will fetch you an excellent job.'),
(1106, 56, 'Advice for KGP Junta', 'What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them?', 'When there is this dilemma of going for core profile or not, one must notice that getting a job in the core is tricky because there are fewer opportunities, but at the same time, it is easy as fewer people are trying, so now it is balanced. Most people think that core is complex, so very few are trying. So I would say that if you are interested, you should try because many people believe that it is challenging, and they drop the idea of taking up the core. Also, if you are confused, you can prepare for two profiles; preparing for two profiles is not very hectic, in my opinion. Because we generally have ample time to explore things in KGP. I wasted too much time still I was able to prepare for both of them. Hence, even you guys can also do it. I wish all the very best to everyone out there!'),
(1107, 54, 'Explain Product Management', 'Could you explain to us about the field of ‘Product Management’?', 'The main focus of the Product Management field is analysing how an existing product or a new product within a broad segment can be improved or shaped in its conceptual design, available features, brand marketing and ease of accessibility, primarily to serve the targets of expanding into new customer base and further enhancing the experience of the existing customer base. This analysis is carried out using various tools/frameworks of interpretation of data collected from research, industry, product statistics, etc. It combines it with a contextual understanding of consumer behaviour, derived using study, observation, and experience of various dimensions of the society.'),
(1108, 54, 'General Interview Process', 'What was the general interview process for the company you interviewed, and tell us how to prepare for that? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'There were three One-On-One rounds in the process carried out on Google Meet. There was no separation of rounds as “technical” or “HR” as there was reasonably diverse interaction involved during each round. As soon as a round got completed, I moved into a new meeting link, and thus the three rounds carried on successively roughly. The entire process lasted for about 60–70 minutes.'),
(1109, 54, 'Is Tech Round Involved', 'One general doubt, is there any technical round involved in the process? And does one need to know how to code for product management roles?', 'There is no technical round involved in the process. You don’t require coding experience for PM roles.'),
(1110, 54, 'Questions from different rounds', 'Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical problems, any other discussion in general that you think will prove helpful for students.', 'A Product Case Study [PPT format] submission was to be submitted on how WhatsApp can integrate digital payment about two weeks before the first day of interviews. On Interview: [1] In the first round, I was asked to tell about myself, long-term goals etc. and give insights on a couple of simple real-world problems related to decision making. Example: Suppose I give you a piece of land (not fertile, can’t be used for agriculture), what will you do with it? And follow up questions based on the replies. [2] In the second round, I was asked questions based on my Internship/Project. Then they made me solve a classic Product Case: to think of a new product feature in the finance segment and design its rough user experience and insights on what nudges can be used in marketing it. [3] The final round made me analyse a website, spending about 10–15 minutes navigating through it, giving input on what changes can be done to various website features to make it a more user-friendly experience and improve its brand perception.'),
(1111, 54, 'Basic FAQs', 'What are some of the FAQs you face and think students must prepare for in most companies? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'Fortunately I faced only one company. Questions like, how has your college life, internship/project, has helped in shaping you up, what are your long term goals, what are subjects and skills that you enjoy pursuing the most, why did you choose this particular sector and firm, are some examples of common HR questions.'),
(1112, 54, 'Advice for Juniors sitting for placements', 'What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector?', 'On a personal level, I did not prepare for Product Management apart from working on a Financial Product for about a month in my Internship, but it is helpful to spend one-two weeks solving standard Product Cases for those entirely new for the domain. Later on, as placement season comes closer, solving CAT-type aptitude problems and mock interviews based on CV and HR questions might help because they are asked in almost all tests across sectors.'),
(1113, 54, 'Role of PORs', 'And how far do the positions of responsibility on the campus help you? How has life in KGP has supported you for this role?', 'My early experience in Awaaz helped me become better at reading and writing and, more importantly, to get in touch with seniors, make some good friends live, and share various life experiences that would help me understand myself and the world I am in better. Later on, working on case studies and projects in setting up Shastrarth, apart from getting better pictures of the local student community, I learned crucial aspects of design and leadership, primarily through new interactions and repeated failures in various plans. While taking upon these responsibilities, I never had any professional leverage to target by the position. It is more the lessons as mentioned earlier acquired with the flow that helps in professional roles.'),
(1114, 54, 'Advices for All', 'Anything else that you would want to share with the students?', 'Often, it is who you are outside your CV points that matter in the long run. The most important piece of advice is not to be bothered much about what others are doing. Curate your decisions according to your goals, be it any sector or role.'),
(1115, 53, 'Explain Product Management', 'Interviewer: Could you explain to us about the field of ‘’Product Management’’?', ' If you look at the profile of product management, it is relatively a very young profile, started around 2001 when the internet came into the picture, and many startups were booming into Silicon Valley in the US. There was a need for a role that coordinated with various teams of a company like the Business team, UI team and Software team. They used to figure out what users’ problems are, what they want from their digital products, what problems to solve, what pain to prioritize, and when there was a need for a person who can do that. PMs are user representative of the company, and they coordinate with all the teams to work on projects that are most important to the company and the users. Product management is about solving users’ problems through different features and additions to the product.'),
(1116, 53, 'General Interview Process', 'What was the general interview process for the company you interviewed, and tell us how to prepare for that? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'The Selection procedure of Flipkart will almost encompass a month or a month and a half. It will start from a regular ppt session in which they will tell you about product management. This time, they had a workshop where they gave the students a basic idea of the kind of cases they will be facing, and they had a case workshop after the ppt. Moving on from that, Flipkart every year has a deck submission to be provided which finalizes you to be shortlisted. They keep a similar problem statement every year, but they changed their problem statement this year due to COVID. So, you have a problem statement wherein you have to submit a deck. It’s a small deck of typically 8–10 slides explaining how you solve the problem with the help of technology. This year we had a shortlist of 8 students. Depending on your buddies and how you interact with them, you will have 3–4 buddy sessions with the 8–10 students selected in the company in the past 2–3 years. They will help you in gaining interview experience. So they will conduct mock interviews. After you shortlist in the final interview, you will have some 15–20 days to prepare well for your interview, and you will give some 2 or 3 buddy sessions in that time frame. Suppose that in Flipkart, you have five rounds to get selected. Finally, each round is an elimination round. The first round is simply problem-solving. The following two rounds revolve around product design and product thinking. The fourth round is a technical round which checks your basic knowledge of how the tech system works and whether you understand them well. The last round is Fit Round. How you are fit for the role and the company. That is how the selection procedure goes for Flipkart. Next is how to prepare for: 1. PPT (Pre-placement talk) of Flipkart: It is essential that you attend that ppt because that clears many doubts around product management, what people look for in a candidate, what exactly is the role, what exactly we are preparing for. Also, from the past year, they have started to conduct a workshop after that ppt. It gives a good head start. 2. Slide or Deck Submission: Last year, the problem set was based on covid; every year, the problem statement will change. But the main thing is to solve a problem using technology. If you have the essential skill of breaking down problems, use technology to solve every pinpoint problem. They are more interested in how you reach the solution. So whatever may be the number of submissions, only 8–10 students will clear that round. So, focus well on your deck submission; you have 10–12 days for that. So break your problem well, don’t try to solve it as a whole. 3. Product case: After the deck submission, I started preparing for the product case post my deck submission shortlist. Whoever wants to sit for placement for non-core roles like product management, product analyst role, business analyst or marketing, I want to encourage them to first prepare for the consult case interview. It will help you understand many aspects of a case interview, help you know how to define a problem, break a problem, and structure your thoughts very well. Even though I have done some preliminary case preparation, at least I cleared the basics, so I shortlisted for Flipkart. That is the time when you should start working on different types of product case rounds. These are divided into 3 buckets: Problem-solving, the other is the product thinking bucket, and the third bucket is the other market entry cases. Now all of those 3 cases, you will have pretty good buddy sessions with your buddy associated with Flipkart so that they will guide you well into the process. You can form product cases around you, try to solve issues every day. We generally solved two or three cases each day; we used to have 2-hour calls every day to solve cases with each other, and finally, we had buddy cases each week with our seniors. For preparing for all these three types of interview, a lot of resources are available. There are many good books, like cracking the PM interview, preparing for the Product Interview, or Decode and Conquer; youtube channels like Exponent or StellarPeers or Product Management exercises are available. Watching mock interviews are a great source of learning. So I think there are resources available online. As some essential preliminary case interview, you can start going through them and look for problems on each bucket and then solve them, solving as many cases as you can. I will recommend solving 2 cases per day to crack the APM round; other than that, Flipkart also has some technical rounds. This technical round checks fundamental technical understanding, so there is an excellent book “Swipe to Unlock”, which you can refer to, which will walk you through the basics of all the technologies around you. Working in Product Management, you have to interact with the software engineers. You have many videos on youtube; you can refer to them to understand how basic things, like how WhatsApp messaging, how google drive or some basic questions like how the google search works, so that is it & the last round is off. 4. Product fit round: This round is like any other round where they will ask you fundamental questions like what will you do in future situations, like when you have to help your Colleague who is facing some issues or why Flipkart, why the APM role, so all of those questions.'),
(1117, 53, 'Is Tech Round Involved', ' One general doubt, is there any technical round involved in the process? And does one need to know how to code for product management roles?', 'Yes, the technical round is there, but coding is not required in this round. When you go even into your role as APM or as a product manager, there will be shipping features, you will be primarily working on digital products, and you would have to shift elements with your software engineers. Shipping features is like releasing a new update, even when you feel like daily, the Flipkart has is you were using from the ten years, you have seen a lot of changes in that. You can see many changes in the interface, so the people responsible for that changes are product managers, but they should know how these changes will come into place and how they have to share their product features with their software team. How they communicate with them, How they build and ship these features. You should understand how fundamental tech works, so you should understand the problems, how you manage the database, how the essential search works, and the difference between the back end and the front end. A lot of these crucial things so that you can ship and communicate with your software engineers better. Coding is not required.'),
(1118, 53, 'Questions from different rounds', 'Could you please list down questions were you asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical problems, any other discussion in general that you think will prove helpful for students.', 'Flipkart doesn’t have any puzzle round; those are all product cases round and the technical and finally the fit round. So my first round was problem-solving, and the problem that I dealt with was that some offer going in the Flipkart with the advertising revenue was not increasing. So I had to find a problem and then give some solutions to counter that. My second round was the problem thinking round. I had to improve the experience of the people age above 45 on google pay; this is my second round. My third round was thinking round, where I had to go ten years back, around the time when Ola started. Then I had to build the algorithm for matching a user (customer) to the driver. In my fourth round, there were fundamental technical questions, like types of databases, how ads work, how to replace an application and a browser, or what technology to get a better experience on Flipkart. The final round was fit, a behavioural round as they set the questions like why APM? Why Product Management? How will you help your Colleague? What is that one problem you observe in Kharagpur? So I think after you clear the four rounds, your 5th round shouldn’t be that hard, but you should be sincere in that round, or you should stick to your strengths and your weaknesses while you share any thoughts in that round.'),
(1119, 53, 'Basic FAQs', 'What are some of the FAQs you face and think students must prepare for in most companies? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'Not just for the context of the HR round, but the point is, there are no frequently asked questions. Questions depend on what company and what role you are interviewing for; the HR questions revolve around them; why this profile? Your profile seems like this, then Why not go for this? I see many people who are very talented going to interview panicking and not able to interact or share their thoughts with the interviewer. This finally leads to their rejections, so I would urge everyone sitting for placements to dedicate some time to think of how the interview will go into your head and what kind of person you want to show about you. Every HR question, every interview starts from “Tell me about yourself”, “Why this role?” So every question has its story behind it. The interviewer who is sitting in front of you has to take 20 or 30 interviews, and if you go on to ramble your CV and go on to tell something that you have learnt in your mind or try to speak it out continuously, it won’t separate you from the crowd. So you must prepare your story well, schedule your personal opinion on yourself. Another important thing I have seen happening with many people (KGPians) was fear of the interview and panic in many discussions with Flipkart. Each year, we see some candidates getting intimidated by the interviewer, so it is essential to stay calm. The interviewer is a guide; when you go for an interview, the interviewer is there only to guide you through the process, think of him as a senior who is helping you to work with a problem and helping you solve it. Suppose you think of him as someone who is here to reject you or someone far higher than you. In that case, people life will be panicking. The critical skill is having your stories defined well, expressing who you are and what you are really and communicating well with the interviewer, and answering your questions well in a good state of mind. These two things will fly you through any HR round and not this HR but any other round if you have any technical knowledge about them.'),
(1120, 53, 'Advice for Juniors sitting for placements', 'What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in this sector?', 'First, this must be about the time of the mid-Feb end, you start preparing for your interview, for your placement in your head, so, first of all, you need to understand what profile you want to target, and then stick to that profile, because you will need a time frame for preparing for any role. It would be best to understand whether I should go with the functions of software or roles that are more inclined towards the non-core roles or more inclined towards the core engineering role. The most important thing people have to keep in mind is that they have built a lot of noise around you while going through the process. Let say you are preparing for the non-core, and your friends keep telling you that. Oh, Dude! You are so poor; you really won’t get placed. One of those is True. Just stick to your strength. So I never coded, never went far for any software role, nor was I giving that test. I don’t want to go for software roles in my future, and I don’t think of myself as a Software Engineer. I know that I want to go for some non-core role, like product management, or consult, or a normal position, like a business analyst or product analyst. So you should know that and stick to it because you will have enough company for each role, stick to two or three core profiles, which you want to target and then go work around that. I think this year. Placements were online, so many people working from home might say that peer pressure was unnecessary because you are at home. Still, you don’t know how the other person is preparing and what other people are doing, so if the next semester you come to the campus, another factor that is a considerable impact is peer pressure; many people are preparing for placement. So think, keep in touch with your peers; peer pressure is significant, but don’t get intimidated by any person. Placement is a very long process, and it starts with the overall autumn semester; remaining calm in the whole process will work, and at the end of the day, you will get good results; you will get good placement, no matter what.'),
(1121, 53, 'Role of PORs', 'And how far do the positions of responsibility on the campus help you? How has life in KGP has supported you for this role?', 'In my first year, I wanted to work on my communication skills, so, I went for every audition that I could find in KGP; I wanted to go in these auditions, talk in that selection round so that I could speak up, I could share my opinion in English, even though very basic. I was a part of E-cell for a year-and-half, I took two positions of responsibilities. They help you a lot in understanding how to present yourself professionally, how to talk to people. I was in the sponsorship team, so I had to make a lot of phone calls. It makes one realize how to present yourself, know their persona, and handle different companies. So if you are looking for the POR as a way to boost up your CV, like a lot of people think of POR as a judging base as a shortlist, it’s not true. Some companies may have some inclination towards POR, but mainly after going through all the placement process, I have seen shortlisting on ideas based on tests and, in some cases, based on consult. A lot of other things matter, your CG, extracurricular activities, internships and not just POR. POR is a way to improve yourself, improve your communication skills, professional skills, and not get your CV shortlisted. Finally, the POR helps you in the interview. So my POR was of E-cell; I learnt how the startup works and how the organizations function. How different roles made each other. So that helped a lot. But I have not seen anyone getting a job just because of their POR.'),
(1122, 53, 'Advices for All', 'Anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'So the most important thing is to be cautious while the placement process is going on. There will be many ups and downs, starting right from when the test starts (some tests begin in June). The shortlists will start coming. Initially, some companies come on Day 0. The important thing is to remain calm throughout the time frame. Some intense buddy sessions are also required; we worked day and night on product cases, 2 or 3 cases round each day professionally. A serious buddy session will determine what profile you want to go for.');

Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'Sure! One has to apply through the CDC portal. There are six rounds of interviews. Usually, before any round of interviews, candidates are shortlisted. First-round consists of a 20-minute extended psychometric test, there were 20 questions with two statements each, and I had to choose one out of them. The test wasn’t tough. It was pretty easy. The second round was a proper psychometric test that was about 1 hour long. The motive behind this round is to check different aspects of your personality, the values you hold on to, how much of a risk lover, or how much risk-averse you are. Most of the companies take this kind of test. For the third round, there was a portal, and I had a set of questions. Each question will pop up for 20 to 30 seconds, and then I had 2 to 3 minutes to give my response, and it was recorded. The fourth round is an in-person interview. They asked HR questions. It ended up with a conversation about my CV, and they asked me to elaborate on the points mentioned in the CV. The fifth round was a team challenge where you’re paired with people from across colleges, and you need to brainstorm and come up with solutions to the problem statement. The sixth round was a panel interview. There were three panels with three panellists each. You’re paired up with one other candidate and discussion with all three panels.'),

The questions in the HR round are like, tell me about yourself or tell me about your plans. I was also asked about my biggest challenge and failure, how do you do assignments that you don’t want to do. In the parallel interview round, they grilled me a little on my CV. As I have mentioned in it, I like reading books, making me guesstimate around books. They also gave me a few situational questions and asked how I would respond to those conditions. You should be honest, keep a smile, and be confident during the selection rounds.'),
(1125, 52, 'Basic FAQs one faces', 'What are some of the FAQs you face and think students must prepare for in most companies? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'In my opinion, the HR interview round is the underrated part of the selection process, but sometimes, people are not selected. In the HR round, they want to learn about your background, how you present your views in front of them, and most importantly, whether you would be a good cultural fit or not. Tell me about yourself, your future goals, your biggest failure, why this firm or role, and how college life helped shape you: these are examples of common HR questions. AB InBev has a set of principles that they follow that is listed on their website. They will give you the situation and judge you based on those principles. It is helpful to visit the company website and find out what they look for in their people. In general, it is good to have some knowledge about the company’s background. Some questions related to my CV were — What exactly did you do in this internship? What did you learn in the internship? What are the skills you have gained in this particular PoR? It would help if you were well-versed with your CV, and you should be comfortable answering any questions related to it.'),
(1126, 52, 'Advice for Juniors', 'What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximise their chances of getting through a company in this sector?', 'One can read interviews online and understand what firms are working on. They will hire you to work on similar projects, so if you know what they are working on, you can answer them how can you be proved helpful for them. Seventy per cent of the selection process tests your personality, and thirty per cent in the business game, for which reading about the industry and few case studies will be helpful. Practice with people. You can practice HR questions with people as all of us have to face that. One valuable thing which I did, was creating an excel sheet, where I listed down all the ten principles and why they are essential to me in the first column. In the second column, I demonstrated this particular trait or characteristic, which will be very helpful as sometimes they ask you questions indirectly so that you get an idea of what they are referring to.'),

(1130, 51, 'General interview process', 'What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'I was shortlisted for a very diverse set of profiles including FMCG, SDE (Software Development Engineer), APM (Associate Product Manager) and BA (Business Analyst). Thankfully, after my first interview on Day 1, I got the offer and did not have to interview for the rest of the companies. The general process is 1 test followed by 1 day of interviews but the GMT(global management trainee) profile follows an unconventional process with a unique system of hiring. There were 6–7 rounds spread across 1 month and the process started at the end of October. The first two rounds were tests, one of which was psychometric and gauged personality traits whereas the other tested focus and attention span. After clearing these preliminary tests, all the rounds which followed were interviews ranging from personal to group interviews. There was one round based on CV and another on HR. There was also a round on situational questions like ‘How will you resolve a conflict between two teammates?’ In group interviews, we were divided into teams and had to come up with a solution within a specified time limit. In the final round, we were paired with one more candidate either from Kgp or another college and were interviewed by the same panel which posed questions out of the box such as ‘What would you do with an aircraft and a billion dollars?’. That was the deciding round.'),
(1131, 51, 'Interview specific puzzles, questions and discussions', 'Could you please list down questions you were asked in the different rounds? Puzzles, technical questions, any other discussion in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'Sure. So first let’s talk about the test. In the psychometric test based on personality, companies basically check your consistency. For example, if the first question is ‘Are you a team player or do you like working alone?’, let’s say you answered that you are a team player. Towards the end, there will be a similar question framed in a different way such as ‘If you are at a party, do you like to socialize with everyone or keep to yourself?’ If you say that you’re a lone wolf, it would be contradictory to your previous answer so it’s essential to be consistent and say that you would prefer socializing. The second test was to check your concentration span, risk-taking abilities etc. For example, there was a question with a grid that had some coloured squares flashed on the screen for 2–3 seconds. The grid was then rotated and you had to re-colour the same squares from memory. For such a test, you need to have a cool mind. Don’t even think of it as an ‘exam’ that you need to crack to get a job because that would make you nervous. Instead, consider it a game and give it your best. After that, there were two 2–3 rounds of personal interviews. It is important to brush up on all the projects mentioned in your CV along with the technical details. For instance, I had a patent filed in the USA so my interviewer asked me, ‘If you are on Shark Tank, how will you pitch your invention to me?’ If you have a POR (Position of Responsibility), it is a good idea to talk about how you led your team and what were the obstacles you overcame while organising events. That shows leadership and ownership as well as time management. They will also ask you how you would tackle certain situations such as ‘If your team was unable to meet a deadline, what would you do?’ It’s a good idea to pull examples out of your CV where you dealt with a similar situation and that would create an impactful answer. Finally, for group interviews, try to avoid the common mistake of talking too much. Group discussions are more about listening to what others have to say, understanding all their various perspectives and weighing out their pros and cons. That shows you are a good listener and team player who takes the opinions of everyone into account. It also portrays you as a leader who formulates collective solutions by amalgamating the advantages of all the various solutions presented to you.'),
(1132, 51, 'FAQs during HR rounds', 'What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must definitely prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'Almost all the companies ask questions like ‘Why do you want to join our firm?’, ‘Why should we hire you?’, ‘Why are you interested in this particular profile?’ etc. It’s basically just one question framed in many different ways that all have the same answer — the culture of the company! Every company has a certain set of values that you can find on their website. It’s this list of values that form their culture and while hiring, HR looks for the same values in candidates. Big brands like AB InBev receive applications from thousands of talented people who want to join their firm. Since almost everyone is very skilled, what becomes a deciding factor at that point is who fits into their culture and who does not. In the HR round, we were asked questions like ‘What are your biggest achievements?’, ‘What are your biggest failures?’, ‘How did you overcome your failures?’ etc. Pick instances from your CV and explain them. For situational questions like ‘You have expertise in a certain aspect of a project and would be able to deliver well on it but someone else wants to work on it too. How will you convince him/her to work on a different aspect of the project?’, link your answer to at least one value of the company. Let’s say the company considers teamwork an important value of their culture. You can answer by saying that you will negotiate with and suggest to the other person to work on an aspect of the project that they have greater expertise in because that would lead to better results for the team’s project goals. This shows that you prioritise the success of your team, believe in teamwork and have an important value of the company so you can fit into their culture well.'),

You might find yourself in situations where you are working in a field that you have no expertise in so you will learn to teach yourself. You might find yourself in a team where most of the people are senior to you and you will learn how to convince them to adapt to new and more efficient systems. All of this really helps you expand your horizons and consequently have a strong CV.'),

We often don’t realise that we’re quite well-prepared for technical rounds and should instead focus on HR rounds towards the end because most of us have little experience in that area. One change I made to my preparation when I got shortlisted was ramping up my HR preparation. I found a lot of question banks online which have almost all the questions that interviewers can ask you and the situations they can put you in, along with their answers. If you are not much of a reader, there are some YouTube channels like https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrtPXCqjm9c7nqgJL-vBSZg which have very structured videos on how to answer every single HR question, right from ‘Tell me about yourself’ upto ‘How will you know when it’s time to quit your job?’ Apart from that, know all the facts about the company. You can read up on their history as well as their recent events in the news. Be aware of new products they’re launching or campaigns they’re planning and so on.'),
(1135, 51, 'Parting advice', 'Anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'Don’t take up anything just for the sake of putting it up on your CV, do it because you actually like doing it. When you find yourself engaged in something that you really enjoy, you are bound to succeed and excel in it. So it will automatically end up on your CV. Sign up for projects with the open-mindedness and excitement to learn something new and not just to highlight it in your resume. Also, see your competitors as collaborators. Share your resources with others, study in groups and help each other out because that way you will be much better prepared rather than being all on your own.'),
